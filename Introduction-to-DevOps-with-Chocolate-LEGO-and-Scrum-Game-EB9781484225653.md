Book Description
-----------------

 Discover a role-based simulation game designed to introduce DevOps in a very unusual way. Working with LEGO and chocolate, using avatars, personas, and role cards, you will gain an understanding of the Dev and Ops roles as well as their interdependencies. Throughout the game, players go through a range of emotions and learn to expand the boundaries of individual roles, acquire T-shaped skills, and grow the Scrum-team circle to include Operations.
The game combines ideas from "The Phoenix Project" with the experience gained from real-life challenges, encountered by development and operations teams in many organizations. Security vulnerabilities, environments patching, deployment code freeze, development and operations silos - the game helps simulate an end-to-end product delivery process and visualize the bottlenecks in the value delivery flow.
Introduction to DevOps with Chocolate, LEGO and Scrum Game engages all five senses to maximize learning effectiveness and in three sprints takes players through a gamified DevOps transformation journey.
