Book Description
-----------------

For nearly four decades, video games have captured the imaginations and drawn the ire of people around the world. Actors play them. Rappers promote them. Politicians want to control them. Even baseball legends make them. Video games are a cultural crossroads where business, entertainment, and technology converge.
Sales of video games, hardware, and accessories reach upwards of $20 billion every year in the United States alone, and more than two-thirds of American households include video games in their daily lives. In a world that seems overflowing with fortune and success, the vicious truth of this booming industry can be easily forgotten: failure is tradition.
And while there are a few businesses that have withstood the test of time, most startups exit as quickly as they enter. Many firms are outpaced by the explosive worldwide growth and economic realities of the industry. In this groundbreaking anthology, successful founders of entertainment software companies reflect on the challenges and how they survived.
"This is the first time that a history of the video-game industry has been told through the personal stories of the entrepreneurs who pushed the business forward. [...] Gamers at Work is a critical resource for new and experienced business leaders—for anyone who feels unprepared for the demanding and seemingly insurmountable trials ahead of them."
—Peter Molyneux OBE, Creative Director, Microsoft Studios Europe
