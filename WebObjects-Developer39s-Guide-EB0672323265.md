WebObjects is an object-oriented Web application server that is used to generate scalable Web and Java applications from reusable templates. A product of Apple Computer, WebObjects¿ client list includes such Fortune 500 companies as Disney, Adobe, and the BBC. The product¿s support for Java 2 Enterprise Edition and its competitive pricing are expected to expand WebObjects¿ growing position in the market for Web application servers, a market that is expected to grow by more than $2 billion in revenue by 2002 (Forrester Research).
