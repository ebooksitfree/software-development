Book Description
-----------------

If you've always wanted to learn how to program a computer, or to learn the popular C++ programming language in particular, this book offers an ideal way to get you started.

In no time, you'll be writing and showing off your own programs!
Yes, programming can be a complex task, and C++ is a language often used by professionals. In fact, many of the coolest games, graphics, and Internet applications are created with C++, and it's even been used on the Mars rovers. But the language, like the monster pictured on the cover, need not be all that fearsome.
