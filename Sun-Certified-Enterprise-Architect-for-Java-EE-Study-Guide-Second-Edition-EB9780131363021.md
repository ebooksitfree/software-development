Book Description
-----------------

Definitive, Comprehensive SCEA Exam Prep–Straight from Sun’s Exam Developers!
This book delivers complete, focused review for Sun’s new Sun Certified Enterprise Architect (SCEA) for Java EE certification exam–straight from two of the exam’s creators! SCEA lead developer/assessor Mark Cade and SCEA lead developer/assessor Humphrey Sheil offer powerful insights, real-world architectural case studies, and challenging sample questions that systematically prepare you for the actual exam. For every question, the authors show why the right answers are right–and why the other answers are wrong. Cade and Sheil cover every SCEA exam topic, skill, and technique, including:
  Understanding system architecture and its goals 
 Decomposing larger systems into components organized by tiers or layers 
 Addressing requirements for scalability, maintainability, reliability, availability, extensibility, performance, and security 
 Building effective web (presentation) tiers, and analyzing tradeoffs associated with using web frameworks 
 Leveraging EJB 3’s enhancements for business tier development 
 Covering new enhancements in the JEE 5 platform 
 Choosing and architecting the best integration and messaging components for your system 
 Using the Java security model to enforce confidentiality, integrity, authorization, authentication, and non-repudiation 
 Using the most powerful and useful Java EE architecture patterns 
 Documenting Java EE architectures through visual models and narratives 
The authors also present detailed guidance for handling every element of the SCEA exam–including your development and defense of a complete real-world architectural solution.
