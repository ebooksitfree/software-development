Summary
Spring Roo in Action is a unique book that teaches you how to code Java in Roo, with a particular focus on Spring-based applications. Through hands-on examples, you'll learn how Roo creates well-formed application structures and supports best practices and tools. Plus, you'll get a quick-and-dirty guide to setting up Roo effectively in your environment.
About the Technology
Roo is a lightweight Java console shell that simplifies compile-time tasks. It improves productivity by enforcing correct coding practices and patterns and integrates with mainstream Java technologies, including ActiveMQ, GWT, JPA, and OSGi. And, when you finish coding, it gets out of the way so there’s no runtime impact.
