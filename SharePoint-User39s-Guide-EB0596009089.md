Book Description
-----------------

There's nothing like teamwork for making progress on a project, but sharing information and building on each other's successes can be challenging when your team is scattered across the miles. Microsoft's SharePoint helps teams and organizations close the distance. With SharePoint, groups construct web sites specifically for collaboration--sites where individuals can capture and share ideas, and work together on documents, tasks, contacts, and events. It's the next best thing to being in the room together.Unfortunately, much of the documentation for SharePoint is written to help system administrators get it up and running, which often leaves end users in the dark. The SharePoint User's Guide takes another approach: this quick and easy guide shows you what you need to know to start using SharePoint effectively and how to get the most from it.  You'll learn how to create sites that your organization can use to work together or independently, from an end user's point of view. Now, even beginners can learn how to:
access sites that are already set upcreate new sitespersonalize sitesuse the document and picture libraries for adding and editing contentadd discussion boards and surveys to a siteenhance securityYou'll learn how you can receive alerts to tell you when existing documents and information have been changed, or when new information or documents have been added.  You can even share select information with partners or customers outside your organization. No one that uses SharePoint collaboration services can afford to be without this handy book.The SharePoint User's Guide is designed to help you find answers quickly, explaining key concepts and major points in straightforward language.  With SharePoint, any team or organization can overcome geographic or time-zone challenges, and the SharePoint User's Guide will show them how.
