Book Description
-----------------

 Written by the core development team of JHipster and fully updated for JHipster 6, Java 11, and Spring Boot 2.1, this book will show you how to build modern web applications with real-world examples and best practices
Key FeaturesBuild full stack applications with modern JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue.js Explore the JHipster microservices stack, which includes Spring Cloud, Netflix OSS, and the Elastic Stack Learn advanced local and cloud deployment strategies using Docker and KubernetesJHipster is an open source development platform that allows you to easily create web apps and microservices from scratch without spending time on wiring and integrating different technologies. Updated to include JHipster 6, Java 11, Spring Boot 2.1, Vue.js, and Istio, this second edition of Full Stack Development with JHipster will help you build full stack applications and microservices seamlessly. 
You'll start by understanding JHipster and its associated tools, along with the essentials of full stack development, before building a monolithic web app. You'll then learn the JHipster Domain Language (JDL) with entity modeling using JDL-Studio. With this book, you'll create production-ready web apps using Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Angular, and Bootstrap, and run tests and set up continuous integration pipelines with Jenkins. As you advance, you'll learn how to convert your monoliths to microservices and how to package your application for production with various deployment options, including Heroku and Google Cloud. You'll also learn about Docker and Kubernetes, along with an introduction to the Istio service mesh. Finally, you'll build your client-side with React and Vue.js and discover JHipster's best practices. 
By the end of the book, you'll be able to leverage the best tools available to build modern web apps.
What you will learnCreate full stack apps from scratch using the latest features of JHipster 6 and Spring Boot 2.1 Build business logic by creating and developing entity models using JDL Understand how to convert a monolithic architecture into a full-fledged microservices architecture Build and package your apps for production using Docker Deploy your application to Google Cloud with Kubernetes Create continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines with Jenkins Create applications using Angular, React, and Vue.js client-side frameworksWho this book is forThis book is for full stack developers who want to build web applications and microservices speedily without writing a lot of boilerplate code. If you're a backend developer looking to learn full stack development with JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as Angular, React, and Vue.js, you'll find this book useful.
