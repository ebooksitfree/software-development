Book Description
-----------------

 This is the first book to describe the recent significant changes to the .NET compilation process and demonstrate how .NET developers can use the new Compiler API to create compelling applications. As an open source compiler, the Compiler API now makes its code available for anyone to use. In this book, you'll get a concise, focused view of this tremendous resource for developers, who can now use any part of the platform implementation to their advantage in analyzing applications, improving code generation, and providing enforceable patterns, all under an OSS model.
You will learn how to analyze your code for defects in a fast, clean manner never available before. You'll work with solutions and projects to provide automatic refactoring, and you'll discover how you can generate code dynamically to provide application implementations at runtime
Having the Compiler API available opens a number of doors for .NET developers that were either simply not there before, or difficult to achieve. However, the API is vast, and this concise book provides a valuable roadmap to this new development environment.
What You Will Learn:
Understand how to generate, compile, and execute code for a number of scenarios
How to create diagnostics and refactoring to help developers enforce conventions and design idioms
Experiment with the compiler code base and see what can be done to influence the inner workings of the compilation pipeline
Who This Book Is For: Experienced .NET developers, but detailed compiler knowledge is not necessary.
