Book Description
-----------------

Use Six Sigma to achieve and sustain excellence in product development and commercialization!
To sustain growth and profitability, companies must tightly align product development and commercialization to fast-changing customer requirements. In this book, Clyde Creveling identifies the four process areas most crucial to doing so—and shows executives and managers how to optimize each of them.
Creveling introduces a Six Sigma-enabled workflow that encompasses strategic product/technology portfolio definition and development, research and technology development (R&amp;TD), tactical design engineering processes for commercialization, and operational production and service support. He presents tools, methods, and best practices for selecting the right projects, prioritizing them, and executing them rapidly, consistently, and successfully.
  Integrate all key technical processes so they work together in harmony 
  Create Phase/Gate control plans for delivering products with minimal risk 
  Establish scorecards for risk management in technical processes 
 Use Six Sigma tools, such as Monte Carlo and FMEA, to improve project management 
 Bring discipline to your product and technology portfolio renewal processes 
 Systematically optimize your commercialization processes 
 Define stripped-down “Fast Track” processes for commercializing high-risk, high-reward opportunities 
 Provide effective operational support after you launch your product 
 Preview the future of “lean” and Six Sigma in technical processes 
 Use lean techniques to streamline repeatable processes such as R&amp;D, product design, and post-launch production engineering support 
 Learn how to manage the risk of doing a fast track commercialization project when you really must cut corners to get a product out into the market before your opportunity evaporates
