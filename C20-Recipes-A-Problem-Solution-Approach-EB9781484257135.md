Book Description
-----------------


    
    Discover the newest major features of C++20, including modules, concepts, spaceship operators, and smart pointers.&nbsp;This book is a handy code cookbook reference guide that covers the C++ core language standard as well as some of the code templates available in standard template library (STL). 
In C++20 Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach, you'll find numbers, strings, dates, times, classes, exceptions, streams, flows, pointers, and more. Also, you'll see various code samples, templates for C++ algorithms, parallel processing, multithreading, and numerical processes. It also includes 3D graphics programming code. A wealth of STL templates on function objects, adapters, allocators, and extensions are also available.
This is a must-have, contemporary reference for your technical library to help with just about any project that involves the C++ programming language.&nbsp;&nbsp;
