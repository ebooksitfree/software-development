Book Description
-----------------

Tired of video games in which the sound lags far behind the rest of the user's experience? If so, and if you're ready to do better, you need this forward-looking volume! In these pages, sound artist extraordinaire Alexander Brandon provides a broad-ranging exploration of how game audio is created today and how it should be done in the future in order to create groundbreaking audio. After providing a map of the audio development process in Chapter 1, Alexander discusses the basic preproduction, workflow, production, post-production, and technology issues audio designers must address today. Then, after a post-mortem analysis of the audio development process for a game that's currently on the market, Alexander takes a good, hard look at the heights to which video-game audio can be taken in chapters on ideal workflow, technology, and production. Throughout, the focus is on the practical advice you need to create better (and better!) sound!
