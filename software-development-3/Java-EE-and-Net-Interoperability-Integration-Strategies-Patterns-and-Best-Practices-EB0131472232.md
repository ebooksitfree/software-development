Book Description
-----------------

 “It’s a fact the .NET and Java platforms exist in the enterprise with many touch points. Developers are very eager for information and examples on how the two environments can coexist. This book reflects our interoperability collaboration with Sun and provides best practices for using Web services to bridge .NET and Java applications.”
 —DAN’L LEWIN
corporate vice-president,
Developer &amp; Platform Evangelism, Microsoft Corp.
“This book is a developer handbook for implementing interoperable applications and services. It includes actionable strategies for developers and best practices from the field experience.”
—GREG PAPADOPOULOS
chief technology officer, Sun Microsystems
“A comprehensive, practical guide to developing applications that cross the Java EE .NET boundary.”
—BILL SMITH
director business alliances, Sun Microsystems
“Efficient, effective interoperability between Java EE and .NET is a crucial element in the IT architecture of large enterprises and is vital to running a successful business. This book takes interoperability to the next level, far beyond the cold coexistence of systems, by describing effective strategies that allow you to achieve true interoperability while reducing complexity in your applications and your data center. Additionally, it provides examples and practical advice on how to achieve this new level of interoperability and covers in depth all of the options available from bridging, to porting, to platform unification. The costs that this can save you, from management, maintenance and server consolidation are very significant.”
 —YAACOV COHEN
chief executive officer, Mainsoft
“A complete and up-to-date coverage of Java EE .NET security interoperability standards and related specifications.”
 —HUBERT A. LE VAN GONG
architect, Sun Microsystems, and the
coauthor of “Web SSO MEX Specification”
Evolving Web services standards and technologies offer limited interoperability when it comes to security, management, and other important application characteristics. Successful interoperability solutions require comprehensive integration strategies that go beyond simple connections. The capability to mitigate security and reliability risks and transactional support is critical to interoperability.
Java EE and .NET Interoperability addresses issues encountered during the integration process, such as a diverse technology set, incompatible APIs, and disparate environment maintenance. The experienced authors outline strategies, approaches, and best practices, including messaging, Web services, and integration-related frameworks and patterns. The book also introduces readers to Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), the building block for scalable and reliable enterprise integration solutions.
This indispensable book provides the Java EE and .NET developer community with multiple strategies to integrate between Java EE and .NET platforms that save developers time and effort. Applying proven interoperability solutions significantly reduces the application development cycle. Coverage includes
 ·         Effective Java EE–.NET integration strategies and best practices
 ·         Detailed enterprise coverage, as well as standalone Java EE component integration with .NET
 ·         SOA as a building block for Java EE–.NET interoperability
 ·         Interoperability security issues and risk mitigation
 ·         Managing reliability, availability, and scalability for Web services built on Java EE and .NET
 ·         The latest interoperability standards and specifications, including Web SSO MEX and WS-Management
 ·         Current interoperability technologies, such as Windows Communication Foundation, WSE 3.0, JAX-WS, and Enterprise Service Bus
