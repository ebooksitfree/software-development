Book Description
-----------------

This is the digital version of the printed book (Copyright © 2005).  If you develop software without understanding the requirements, you're wasting your time.  On the other hand, if a project spends too much time trying to understand the requirements, it will end up late and/or over-budget. And products that are created by such projects can be just as unsuccessful as those that fail to meet the basic requirements.  Instead, every company must make a reasonable trade-off between what's required and what time and resources are available.  Finding the right balance for your project may depend on many factors, including the corporate culture, the time-to-market pressure, and the criticality of the application. That is why requirements management—gathering requirements, identifying the "right" ones to satisfy, and documenting them—is essential.  Just Enough Requirements Management shows you how to discover, prune, and document requirements when you are subjected to tight schedule constraints. You'll apply just enough process to minimize risks while still achieving desired outcomes. You'll determine how many requirements are just enough to satisfy your customers while still meeting your goals for schedule, budget, and resources.  If your project has insufficient resources to satisfy all the requirements of your customers, you must read Just Enough Requirements Management.
