Book Description
-----------------

 Learn only the essential aspects of Python without cluttering up your mind with features you may never use. This compact book is not a "best way to write code" type of book; rather, the author goes over his most-used functions, which are all you need to know as a beginner and some way beyond.
Lean Python takes 58 Python methods and functions and whittles them down to 15: as author Paul Gerrard says, "I haven't found a need for the rest."
What You'll LearnDiscover lean Python and how to learn just enough to build useful toolsUse Python objects, program structure, I/O, modules and moreHandle errors and exceptions Test your codeAccess the Web; do searching; and persist dataWho This Book Is ForThis book is aimed at three categories of reader: The experienced programmer – if you already know a programming language, this book gives you a shortcut to understanding the Python language and some of its design philosophy. You work in IT and need a programming primer – you might be a tester who needs to have more informed technical discussions with programmers. Working through the examples will help you to appreciate the challenge of good programming. First-timer – you want a first book on programming that you can assimilate quickly to help you decide whether programming is for you.
