Book Description
-----------------

Harness the power of Cocos2D to create your own stunning and engaging games for iOS
In Detail
Cocos2D-iPhone (Cocos2D-Swift) is a robust yet simple-touse 2D game framework for iPhone. If you are just starting with game programming, Cocos2D will enable you to make your first game in no time. Even if you are a seasoned game developer, you will still be able to benefit from what Cocos2D offers.
This book will set you on the fast-track to game development with Cocos2D for iPhone. You will start by reviewing the basic classes and hierarchy, dive deep into animations and game flow, and finish by creating a complete game with UI using some advanced techniques.
You will begin the book with an empty Cocos2D project and build on it until you end up with a complete game. The book will teach you how to work on game logic, handling user input, controlling the character, and playing audio. Later, in the final part of the book, we'll have a working game on our hands, and we'll see how we can improve the game further
