Book Description
-----------------

 Build a microservices architecture with Spring Boot, by evolving an application from a small monolith to an event-driven architecture composed of several services. This book follows an incremental approach to teach microservice structure, test-driven development, Eureka, Ribbon, Zuul, and end-to-end tests with Cucumber.Author Moises Macero follows a very pragmatic approach to explain the benefits of using this type of software architecture, instead of keeping you distracted with theoretical concepts. He covers some of the state-of-the-art techniques in computer programming, from a practical point of view. Youâ€™ll focus on what's important, starting with the minimum viable product but keeping the flexibility to evolve it.What You'll LearnBuild microservices with Spring BootUse event-driven architecture and messaging with RabbitMQCreate RESTful services with SpringMaster service discovery with Eureka and load balancing with RibbonRoute requests with Zuul as your API gatewayWrite end-to-end rests for an event-driven architecture using CucumberCarry out continuous integration and deploymentWho This Book Is ForThose with at least some prior experience with Java programming. Some prior exposure to Spring Boot recommended but not required.        Show and hide more
