Book Description
-----------------

 Innovative Change Management (ICM) represents the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of one of the world’s foremost performance improvement specialists. It includes a clear and thorough explanation of the necessary critical tools for creating a system that results in a much higher percentage of your initiatives progressing to successful projects. Studies conducted by organizations such as Gartner, Ernst &amp; Young, and Harrington Management Systems indicate that on average less than 25% of the innovative projects achieve sustained success. The American Productivity Quality Center's 2018 survey report pointed out that 88% of the organizations felt that process management discipline must be changed and 53.8% felt they must create a continuous improvement culture. Through the effective use of the ICM methodology, you can turn thousands of lost employee hours into millions of dollars in increased profit.
This book unveils to the reader for the first time how ICM combines project change management, culture change management, and project management concepts to create an effective and innovative organization. These concepts combined result in homogeneous improvements in performance improvement and cultural change. The book outlines a step-by-step procedure designed to apply ICM to complex programs such as process redesign and supply chain management as well as to simpler ones such as relocation of offices. In addition, it provides field-tested change methodologies to help you systematically include change into your strategic management plan.
This book shows you how to:
 
Set the stage for ICM. 
Develop a new management style that encourages innovation. 
Develop and implement a project change management methodology to support the project management methodology. 
Develop a cultural change management program. How to reward and recognize the innovation activities generated by your employees. 
Make ICM an important part of the strategic plan.  
Help employees understand the career-enhancing aspects of change How to maximize your organization’s ROC (return on change).Most of the activity related to change management focuses on successfully implementing individual projects. Statistics indicate that this is not enough to keep up with today’s rapid changing innovative competition. As most profitable organizations are working diligently on increasing their innovation capabilities, this focus is requiring a completely new restructured management style and behavioral patterns that are foreign to most of today’s successful managers.
