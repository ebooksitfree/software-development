Book Description
-----------------

Get Started Fast with iOS Game Programming
Since the launch of the App Store, games have been the hottest category of apps for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. That means your best chance of tapping into the iPhone/iPad “Gold Rush” is to put out a killer game that everyone wants to play (and talk about). While many people think games are hard to build, they can actually be quite easy, and Learning iOS Game Programming is your perfect beginner’s guide. Michael Daley walks you through every step as you build a killer 2D game for the iPhone.
In Learning iOS Game Programming, you’ll learn how to build a 2D tile map game, Sir Lamorak’s Quest: The Spell of Release (which is free in the App Store). You can download and play the game you’re going to build while you learn about the code and everything behind the scenes. Daley identifies the key characteristics of a successful iPhone game and introduces the technologies, terminology, and tools you will use. Then, he carefully guides you through the whole development process: from planning storylines and game play all the way through testing and tuning.
Download the free version of Sir Lamorak’s Quest from the App Store today, while you learn how to build the game in this book.
  
Coverage includes 
 Planning high-level game design, components, and difficulty levels 
 Using game loops to make sure the right events happen at the right time 
 Rendering images, creating sprite sheets, and building basic animations 
 Using tile maps to build large game worlds from small reusable images 
 Creating fire, explosions, smoke, sparks, and other organic effects 
 Delivering great sound via OpenAL and the iPhone’s media player 
 Providing game control via iPhone’s touch and accelerometer features 
 Crafting an effective, intuitive game interface 
 Building game objects and entities and making them work properly 
 Detecting collisions and ensuring the right response to them 
 Polishing, testing, debugging, and performance-tuning your game  
Learning iOS Game Programming focuses on the features, concepts, and techniques you’ll use most often—and helps you master them in a real-world context. This book is 100% useful and 100% practical; there’s never been an iPhone game development book like it!

–Pablo Gomez Basanta, Founder, Shifting Mind
“I always thought that to teach others one has to be an expert and a person with an established reputation in the field. Michael Daley proved me wrong. He is teaching others while studying himself. Michael’s passion in teaching and studying, ease of solutions to problems, and a complete game as a resulting project makes this book one of the best I have ever read.”
–Eugene Snyetilov
“If you’re interested in 2D game programming with the iOS using OpenGL and OpenAL directly, this book walks you through creating a complete and fun game without getting bogged down in technical details.”
–Scott D.Yelich
“Michael Daley brings clarity to the haze of iPhone application development. Concrete examples, thorough explanation, and timesaving tips make this book a must have for the up and coming iPhone game developer.”
–Brandon Middleton, Creator of Tic Tac Toe Ten
“This is the A-Z guide to iOS game development; Michael’s book takes you from the basics and terminology to using the techniques in practice on a fully working game. Before you know it, you will find yourself writing your own game, fueled by a firm grasp of the principles and techniques learned within. I could not ask for a better reference in developing our own games.”
