Book Description
-----------------

 The first stop for your security needs when using Go, covering host, network, and cloud security for ethical hackers and defense against intrusion
About This Book
First introduction to Security with GolangAdopting a Blue Team/Red Team approachTake advantage of speed and inherent safety of GolangWorks as an introduction to security for Golang developersWorks as a guide to Golang security packages for recent Golang beginnersWho This Book Is For
Security with Go is aimed at developers with basics in Go to the level that they can write their own scripts and small programs without difficulty. Readers should be familiar with security concepts, and familiarity with Python security applications and libraries is an advantage, but not a necessity. 
What You Will Learn
Learn the basic concepts and principles of secure programmingWrite secure Golang programs and applicationsUnderstand classic patterns of attackWrite Golang scripts to defend against network-level attacksLearn how to use Golang security packagesApply and explore cryptographic methods and packagesLearn the art of defending against brute force attacksSecure web and cloud applicationsIn Detail
Go is becoming more and more popular as a language for security experts. Its wide use in server and cloud environments, its speed and ease of use, and its evident capabilities for data analysis, have made it a prime choice for developers who need to think about security.
Security with Go is the first Golang security book, and it is useful for both blue team and red team applications. With this book, you will learn how to write secure software, monitor your systems, secure your data, attack systems, and extract information.
Defensive topics include cryptography, forensics, packet capturing, and building secure web applications.
Offensive topics include brute force, port scanning, packet injection, web scraping, social engineering, and post exploitation techniques.
Style and approach
John Leon has divided the book into two parts which present the team playing defense against anyone breaking into servers and the team playing (ethical!) offense to perform said attacks. All Go scripts and programs are workable solutions that can be easily understood and expanded upon by anyone with a system administrator's level view of networking and cloud-based systems. Golang developers will profit from a swift and incisive approach to security.
