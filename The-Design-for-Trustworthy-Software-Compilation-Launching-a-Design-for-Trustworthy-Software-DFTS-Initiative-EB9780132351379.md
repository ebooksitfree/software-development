Book Description
-----------------

This short cut is a reproduction of Chapter 21 of the book Design for Trustworthy Software (DFTS) and is a sequel to Chapters 2, 5, and 20. The Plan, Implement, Control, and Secure (PICS) implementation framework is revisited and its four phases are examined in turn. Building organization-wide competencies to launch and sustain a DFTS initiative is emphasized.
The short cut begins with a review of various planning activities and a summary of deliverables. This is followed by a detailed presentation of the two implementation steps that deal with establishing overall learning objectives, designing and customizing learning curricula, providing training for support personnel and Black Belts and Master Black Belts, and the ensuing application of such learning to an actual software development project. Next is a discussion of monitoring and control mechanisms including self-appraisal, successive appraisal, and review of work carried out to date with the customers. This is followed by a discussion of Simon's Levers of Control, namely, belief systems, boundary systems, diagnostic control systems, and interactive control systems, and of important issues related to internal control systems to ensure integrity of data used in strategic control systems. Finally, operational controls involving feedback control systems and project management is presented.
A case study of GE's Operating System is introduced as a vehicle to launch a new initiative and enrich it through several yearly cycles. Another case study presents Tata Consultancy Services' quality initiatives and their integration. A brief discussion of application in small software firms and e-cottages is provided. The chapter ends with a brief discussion of the future course of a DFTS initiative.
This short cut can be used either as a methodology in deploying the DFTS initiative or as a standalone presentation on launching major organizational initiatives.
This short cut should be of interest to software and quality professionals. In particular, it should be of value to the CMMI, Six Sigma, and DFSS communities worldwide, especially those who have acquired or plan to acquire Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt, or similar competencies in various quality management disciplines. It should also be useful resource for students and academic of various programs at senior undergraduate and graduate levels, and for those preparing for American Society for Quality's (ASQ) Certified Software Quality Engineer (CSQE) examination.
