Ready to learn programming with less effort and more fun? Then do it the lazy way! C++20 for Lazy Programmers uses humor and fun to make you actually willing to read and eager to do the projects as you master the popular and powerful C++ language. Along the way it includes many features from the new C++20 standard, such as ranges, spans, format strings, the “spaceship” operator, and concepts (template parameter requirements), and provides brief introductions to modules and coroutines.
With this unique method, you’ll stretch your abilities with a variety of projects, including your own C++ arcade game. You'll construct your own classes, templates, and abstract data types. After reading and using this book you’ll be ready to build real-world C++ applications and game projects on your own.What You Will Learn:
