Divided into five parts,  Security Law and Methods  discusses the topics of premises liability and negligence, intentional torts and claims, agency and contract based claims, legal authority and liability, and the subject of terrorism. It also offers an evocative look at security issues that may arise in the future. The book serves as a comprehensive and insightful treatment of security, and is an invaluable addition to the current literature on security and the law.Contains clear explanations of complicated legal conceptsIncludes case excerpts, summaries, and discussion questionsSuggests additional research and relevant cases for further study
