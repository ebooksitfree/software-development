Book Description

      Apply lean frameworks and other concepts of software development to the process of your game development. Resistance to Agile methodologies in the gaming industry is most often due to frustrated attempts to use lean tools and frameworks. Lean Game Development teaches you how to apply frameworks and concepts successfully to benefit you and your team. You will see how to manage, develop and coexist in a lean game development environment. You’ll understand what lean is and how it helps the gaming industry. You’ll see how to apply MVP concepts and why you should. The concepts taught are used not only in the design of the software code but also in all stages of the development process. Ideal for any game development company, including indie and small studios, Lean Game Development offers new opportunities for streamlining your workflow and benefiting your game development overall.
