Book Description
-----------------

Microwave photonics continues to see rapid growth. The integration of optical fiber and wireless networks has become a commercial reality and is becoming increasingly pervasive. Such hybrid technology will lead to many innovative applications, including backhaul solutions for mobile networks and ultrabroadband wireless networks that can provide users with very high bandwidth services. Microwave Photonics, Second Edition systematically introduces important technologies and applications in this emerging field. It also reviews recent advances in micro- and millimeter-wavelength and terahertz-frequency systems.
The book features contributions by leading international researchers, many of whom are pioneers in the field. They examine wave generation, measurement, detection, control, and propagation in detail, as well as the devices and components that enable ultrawide-band and ultrafast transmission, switching, and signal processing. These devices and components include optical-controlled microwave devices, optical transmitters, receivers, switching devices, detectors, and modulators. The book explores the theory, techniques, and technologies that are fueling applications such as radio-over-fiber, injection-locked semiconductor lasers, and terahertz photonics. Throughout, the contributors share insights on overcoming current limitations and on potential developments.
