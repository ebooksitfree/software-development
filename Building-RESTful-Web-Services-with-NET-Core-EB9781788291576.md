 Building Complete E-commerce/Shopping Cart Application
About This BookFollow best practices and explore techniques such as clustering and caching to achieve a reactive, scalable web serviceLeverage the .NET Framework to quickly implement RESTful endpoints.Learn to implement a client library for a RESTful web service using ASP.NET Core.Who This Book Is ForThis book is intended for those who want to learn to build RESTful web services with the latest .NET Core Framework. To make best use of the code samples included in the book, you should have a basic knowledge of C# and .NET Core. 
What You Will LearnAdd basic authentication to your RESTful APICreate a Carts Controller and Orders Controller to manage and process OrdersIntercept HTTP requests and responses by building your own middlewareTest service calls using Postman and Advanced REST ClientSecure your data/application using annotationsIn DetailREST is an architectural style that tackles the challenges of building scalable web services. In today's connected world, APIs have taken a central role on the web. APIs provide the fabric through which systems interact, and REST has become synonymous with APIs. The depth, breadth, and ease of use of ASP.NET Core makes it a breeze for developers to work with for building robust web APIs. This book takes you through the design of RESTful web services and leverages the ASP.NET Core framework to implement these services. This book begins by introducing you to the basics of the philosophy behind REST. You'll go through the steps of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service. This book takes a practical approach, that you can apply to your own circumstances. This book brings forth the power of the latest .NET Core release, working with MVC. Later, you will learn about the use of the framework to explore approaches to tackle resilience, security, and scalability concerns. You will explore the steps to improve the performance of your applications. You'll also learn techniques to deal with security in web APIs and discover how to implement unit and integration test strategies. By the end of the book, you will have a complete understanding of Building a client for RESTful web services, along with some scaling techniques.
Style and approachThis book is a step-by-step, hands-on guide to designing and building RESTful web services.
