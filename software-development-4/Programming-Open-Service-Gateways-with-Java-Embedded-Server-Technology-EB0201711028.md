Book Description
-----------------

The Java Embedded Server™ from Sun Microsystems, Inc., is a solution for linking consumer devices with services over the Internet. It is based on the Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) Service Gateway Specification 1.0. Written by authors who are intimately involved with the development and implementation of the specification, Programming Open Service Gateways with Java Embedded Server™ Technology reveals the concepts and inner workings of the Java Embedded Server framework and explains how to program and develop services for open gateways using the Java™ programming language.
With an emphasis on actual coding, this definitive guide begins by explaining the backdrop in which the residential gateway market emerged. Next, the book discusses the history and mission of the Java Embedded Server product and the OSGi consortium. Throughout the book, the Java Embedded Server technical architecture and the OSGi Service Gateway API are presented with examples and detailed implementations. The book's practical, how-to format shows you how to write code for residential gateway applications that is correct, robust, and efficient while avoiding common traps and pitfalls.
Highlights include:
Overview of OSGi architecture, including basic concepts and features
How to install Java Embedded Server and develop service bundles
Design patterns and pitfalls
How to use the OSGi standard services: log service and HTTP service
OSGi Device Access (DA) service
Permission-based security and administration
The future undertakings of the OSGi consortium
The OSGi Service Gateway Specification 1.0
Programming Open Service Gateways with Java Embedded Server™ Technology gives you an insider's perspective on the development process of new applications and services for the residential gateway environment.
