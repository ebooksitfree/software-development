Book Description
-----------------


    
    Go beyond the basics and build complete applications using the Rust programming language.&nbsp;The applications in this book include a high-performance web client, a microcontroller (for a robot, for example), a game, an app that runs on Android, and an application that incorporates AI and machine learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each chapter will be organized in the following format:&nbsp;what this kind of application looks like; requirements and user stories of our example program; an introduction to the Rust libraries used; the actual implementation of the example program, including common pitfalls and their solutions; and a brief comparison of libraries for building each application, if there is no clear winner.
Practical Rust Projects will open your eyes to the world of practical applications of Rust. After reading the book, you will be able to apply your Rust knowledge to build your own projects.&nbsp;
What You Will Learn
