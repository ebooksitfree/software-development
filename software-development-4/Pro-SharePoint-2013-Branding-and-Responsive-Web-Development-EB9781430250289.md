Book Description
-----------------

Pro SharePoint 2013 Branding and Responsive Web Development is the definitive reference on the technologies, tools, and techniques needed for building responsive websites and applications with SharePoint 2013. The book focuses on solutions that provide the best browser experience for the myriad of devices, browsers, and screen orientations and resolutions.
Web technology has changed considerably in the past few years. Microsoft has embraced the new generation of open standards represented by HTML5 and JavaScript, and these changes are represented in a fundamental shift in how SharePoint 2013 supports web content management and publishing. Authors Eric Overfield, Oscar Medina, Kanwal Khipple, and Rita Zhang join forces to dive into the new features and capabilities provided by SharePoint 2013 and combine them with the latest techniques in responsive web design and development to demonstrate how to build modern and progressive websites and applications.
Pro SharePoint 2013 Branding and Responsive Web Development covers the following technologies:
SharePoint 2013 Server Edition
Office 365 SharePoint Online
Expression Blend 2013
Napa Tools for Office and SharePoint Development
Visual Studio 2012
HTML5 and CSS3
JavaScript, JQuery, JQuery UI, Modernizr, and the Bootstrap Framework
SharePoint 2013 Client Object Model
What you'll learn
Through the context of building a complete website on SharePoint 2013 from start to finish, readers will learn how to combine SharePoint 2013 web content management features and capabilities with modern web design and development skills. The key topics to be covered include:
Design Manager - this new feature allows web designers and developers to build SharePoint branding templates using standard HTML and CSS and convert the templates to SharePoint master pages. This opens up branding to a wider audience of designers who struggled with having to understand the complexity of SharePoint and ASP.NET master pages.
Client Object Model - this feature is based on web service technologies for interacting with server-side data from client-side. This feature has been extended significantly to support the new SharePoint application model, which heavily emphasizes client-side development. This book will provide full coverage of utilizing these updated web service technologies and how they can be used to build interactive websites.
Device Channels - similar to the capabilities provided by HTML5 media queries, the new channels capability allows SharePoint to detect client devices and browsers to load the appropriate master page to provide a unique browser experience.
Variations and Translation Services - SharePoint 2013 continues to improve features and capabilities for building multi-lingual sites including new support for integration with professional translation service providers, or automated translation web services.
Term Set Navigation and SEO Improvements - SharePoint 2013 now provides native support for Search Engine Optimization requirements such as page meta fields, as well as a completely new approach to site navigation and human friendly URLs through the use of Managed Metadata navigation.
Who this book is for
Pro SharePoint 2013 Branding and Responsive Web Development is designed for web designers and developers who have existing knowledge of basic website design and development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This book builds upon that foundational knowledge to walk the reader through a complete project lifecycle for building a responsive website on SharePoint 2013.
