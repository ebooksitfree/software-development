Book Description
-----------------

Programming in Objective-C, Fourth Edition
Updated for iOS 5 and ARC
Programming in Objective-C is a concise, carefully written tutorial on the basics of Objective-C and object-oriented programming for Apple's iOS and Mac platforms.
The book makes no assumptions about prior experience with object-oriented programming languages or with the C language (which Objective-C is based upon). Because of this, both beginners and experienced programmers alike can use this book to quickly and effectively learn the fundamentals of Objective-C.
Readers can also learn the concepts of object-oriented programming without having to first learn all of the intricacies of the underlying C programming language. This unique approach to learning, combined with many small program examples and exercises at the end of each chapter, makes Programming in Objective-C ideally suited for either classroom use or self-study.
The fourth edition of this book has been updated to cover the significant changes that first appeared in iOS 5 and Xcode 4.2, including the use of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to improve and simplify memory management in Objective-C programs.
