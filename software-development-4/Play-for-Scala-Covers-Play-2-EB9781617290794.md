About this Book
Play is a Scala web framework with built-in advantages: Scala’s strong type system helps deliver bug-free code, and the Akka framework helps achieve hassle-free concurrency and peak performance. Play builds on the web’s stateless nature for excellent scalability, and because it is event-based and nonblocking, you’ll find it to be great for near real-time applications.
