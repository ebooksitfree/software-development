Book Description
-----------------

 Migrate your existing microservice cluster from ASP .NET to ASP .NET Core. While improved performance and cross-platform support are evident, this book helps you cut through the noise to determine how, when, and to what extent a migration is needed.
Microsoft’s introduction of .NET Core has created a lot of excitement, but also a lot of confusion for developers accustomed to ASP applications and services. This book gives you specific steps to embark on a partial or full SaaS microservices system migration, factoring in limited resources, time, and finances. In addition to practical advice and real-world examples, many mishaps will be shared, providing you with a complete 360-degree view of a migration.
As a developer intimately familiar with the migration process, author Iris Classon shares prescriptive guidance on every part of the system—from code, dependencies, editors, integration, and the deployment pipeline to a distribution model. You will come away with all the information you need to plan and prepare your migration to ASP.NET Core.
