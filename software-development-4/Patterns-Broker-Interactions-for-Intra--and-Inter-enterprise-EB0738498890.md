Book Description
-----------------

The Patterns for e-business are a group of proven, reusable assets that can be used to increase the speed of developing and deploying Web applications. This IBM Redbooks publication concentrates on distributed application integration using the Process-focused Application Integration::Broker application pattern for intra-enterprise, and the Extended Enterprise::Exposed Broker application pattern for inter-enterprise.
Part 1 guides you through the process of selecting an Application and Runtime pattern. Next, the platform specific Product mappings are identified based upon the selected Runtime pattern.
Part 2 presents guidelines on applying the Patterns approach to a sample business scenario and on selecting application integration technologies.
Part 3 provides detailed design, development, and runtime guidelines for intra-enterprise and inter-enterprise integration solutions. It teaches you by example using IBM WebSphere Application Server V5.0 with WebServices Gateway and WebSphere Business Integration Message Broker.
Please note that the additional material referenced in the text is not available from IBM.
