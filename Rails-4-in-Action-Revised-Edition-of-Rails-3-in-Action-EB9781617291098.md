Summary
Rails 4 in Action is a comprehensive introduction to Rails that guides you hands-on through all you'll need to become a competent and confident Rails developer. In it, you'll master Rails 4 by developing a ticket-tracking application that includes RESTful routing, authentication and authorization, file uploads, email, and more.
About the Book
Rails is a full-stack, open source web framework powered by Ruby. Now in version 4, Rails is mature and powerful, and to use it effectively you need more than a few Google searches. You’ll find no substitute for the guru’s-eye-view of design, testing, deployment, and other real-world concerns that this book provides.
Rails 4 in Action is a hands-on guide to the subject. In this fully revised new edition, you’ll master Rails 4 by developing a ticket-tracking application that includes RESTful routing, authentication and authorization, file uploads, email, and more. Learn to design your own APIs and successfully deploy a production-quality application. You’ll see test-driven development and behavior-driven development in action throughout the book, just like in a top Rails shop.
