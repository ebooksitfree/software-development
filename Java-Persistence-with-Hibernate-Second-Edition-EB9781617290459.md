Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
Java Persistence with Hibernate, Second Edition explores Hibernate by developing an application that ties together hundreds of individual examples. In this revised edition, authors Christian Bauer, Gavin King, and Gary Gregory cover Hibernate 5 in detail with the Java Persistence 2.1 standard (JSR 338). All examples have been updated for the latest Hibernate and Java EE specification versions.
About the Technology
Persistence—the ability of data to outlive an instance of a program—is central to modern applications. Hibernate, the most popular Java persistence tool, offers automatic and transparent object/relational mapping, making it a snap to work with SQL databases in Java applications.
