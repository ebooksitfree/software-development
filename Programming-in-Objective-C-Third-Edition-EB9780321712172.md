Book Description
-----------------

Programming in Objective-C, Third Edition is a concise, carefully written tutorial on the basics of Objective-C and object-oriented programming for Apple's iOS and Mac platforms. The book makes no assumptions about prior experience with object-oriented programming languages or with the C language (which Objective-C is based upon). Because of this, both beginners and experienced programmers alike can use this book to quickly and effectively learn the fundamentals of Objective-C. Readers can also learn the concepts of object-oriented programming without having to first learn all of the intricacies of the underlying C programming language. This unique approach to learning, combined with many small program examples and exercises at the end of each chapter, makes Programming in Objective-C ideally suited for either classroom use or self-study. While the Objective-C language itself has not gone through many changes since the introduction of Objective-C 2.0, the Apple development tools that programmers use for Objective-C development on the Mac and on iOS continue to change significantly from year to year. This new edition of Programming in Objective-C adds information about programming for the iPad and iOS4 generally, and updates all information for the latest revisions to the iPhone SDK and Xcode.
