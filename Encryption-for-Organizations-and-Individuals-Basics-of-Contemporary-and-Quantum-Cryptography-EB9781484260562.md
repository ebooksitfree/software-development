Book Description
-----------------


    
    Cryptography and encryption aren't just for geeks and spies—they’re also part of our daily lives. This book enlightens you with the basics of digital cryptography and covers the must-do practices organizations need to implement when it comes to fending off data theft and eavesdroppers. You will uncover the concepts of digital encryption and examine key digital encryption algorithms and their various applications. Gauging cryptography from an enterprise&nbsp;perspective, you will get an in-depth look at common attacks that can occur in your systems and lean how to counter them
Moving on to quantum computing, you will discover how it differs from the current computing paradigm and understand its potential for the future. After clearing the basics, you will take a close look at how quantum computers work in practice. Shifting focus to quantum cryptography, you will learn more about quantum key distribution (QKD) and how it differs from present-day encryption methodologies. You will also consider the current implementations of QKD, including distribution systems by SwissQuantum and QKD-distribution networks provided by the DARPA Quantum Network. Ultimately, you will learn the means of defending against cryptographic attacks in the up-and-coming quantum age, such as utilizing zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) systems.
Deepen your knowledge of cryptographic concepts and be introduced to the new paradigm of quantum cryptography with this book.
