Book Description
-----------------

A step-by-step guide to identifying and defending against attacks on the virtual environment
As more and more data is moved into virtual environments the need to secure them becomes increasingly important. Useful for service providers as well as enterprise and small business IT professionals the book offers a broad look across virtualization used in various industries as well as a narrow view of vulnerabilities unique to virtual environments. A companion DVD is included with recipes and testing scripts.
Examines the difference in a virtual model versus traditional computing models and the appropriate technology and procedures to defend it from attack
Dissects and exposes attacks targeted at the virtual environment and the steps necessary for defense
Covers information security in virtual environments: building a virtual attack lab, finding leaks, getting a side-channel, denying or compromising services, abusing the hypervisor, forcing an interception, and spreading infestations
Accompanying DVD includes hands-on examples and code
This how-to guide arms IT managers, vendors, and architects of virtual environments with the tools they need to protect against common threats.
