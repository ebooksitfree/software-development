Book Description
-----------------

 Increased focus on computer science has recently brought about the new national curriculum in computing.  This book explores the role of Computer Science Teacher in a secondary school environment. An overview of secondary school computing is covered, along with what the role encompasses, the attributes, knowledge and skills required to be a success and useful standards, tools, methods and techniques you can employ. Case studies and quotes from schools and current teachers are also included.  'This is an essential, practical, informative and accessible read for anyone wanting to enter the world of computing teaching, for those already in this world trying to understand the fast changing nature of teaching in this area, for those wanting to recruit such incredibly hard to find computing teachers and for those involved in their training. The enthusiasm for teaching in this area is palpable and makes this a pleasure to read.' Louise Duncan MA (Oxon), Sunbury Manor School, MBA Headteacher  ---    "If you are either training to teach or already teaching the secondary computing curriculum, you will need to know what effective teaching of computing actually looks like. This book is for you. Throughout the book, you will discover the insights found and the journey undertaken by the author, as a head of department, as she transformed her department from teaching ICT to teaching computing. This text will not only help you teach computing in a way that places learners at the centre of your planning but also seeks to motivate, engage and inspire them with a love of the subject, show them the opportunities that computing can present them and how computing shapes their daily learning, rest and play. In addition, the text provides practical guidance and insights for those applying for either their first teaching post or seeking advancement as a secondary computing teacher."
