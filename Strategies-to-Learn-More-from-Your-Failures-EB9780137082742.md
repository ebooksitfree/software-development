Book Description
-----------------

This Element is an excerpt from From Lemons to Lemonade: Squeeze Every Last Drop of Success Out of Your Mistakes (ISBN: 9780131362734) by Dean A. Shepherd. Available in print and digital formats.
How to learn from failed projects—and do it with less pain and suffering!
Projects can and do fail: They cease to exist. The more you’re emotionally attached to a “project” (task, object, person, or activity), the more you experience negative emotions when failure causes it to be lost. These personal strategies can help you “undo” emotional ties to a lost project–and empower yourself to learn from the experience.
