As part of this tutorial you’ll see how to write high-quality code by following conventions and respecting well-known programming principles, making your projects more professional and efficient.
Finally, alongside the core features of Java, you’ll learn skills in some of the newest and most exciting features of the language: Generics, Lambda expressions, modular organization, local-variable type inference, and local variable syntax for Lambda expressions.
