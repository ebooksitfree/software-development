This second edition of The Book of PF is an up-to-date, no-nonsense guide to harnessing the power of PF.

New additions include coverage of CARP load balancing, and expanded coverage of traffic shaping (including ALTQ queue disciplines such as HFSC), and logging and monitoring. Written for anyone who has felt lost in PF's manual pages or baffled by its massive feature set, The Book of PF, 2nd Edition will help you build the high-performance, secure, low maintenance network you need.
