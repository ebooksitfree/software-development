Book Description
-----------------

The Definitive Guide to Java RTS for Developers and Architects 
 For Java developers and architects moving to real-time, and real-time developers moving to Java 
 Walks through start-to-finish case study applications, identifying their constraints and discussing the APIs and design patterns used to address them 
 Written by the former leader of the real-time Java standards process and one of Wall Street’s top real-time developers 
Sun Microsystems’ Java Real-Time System (Java RTS) is proving itself in numerous, wide-ranging environments, including finance, control systems, manufacturing, and defense. Java RTS and the RTSJ standard (JSR-001) eliminate the need for complicated, specialized, real-time languages and operating environments, saving money by leveraging Java’s exceptional productivity and familiarity.
In Real-Time Java™ Programming, two of Sun’s top real-time programming experts present the deep knowledge and realistic code examples that developers need to succeed with Java RTS and its APIs. As they do so, the authors also illuminate the foundations of real-time programming in any RTSJ-compatible environment.
Key topics include
 Real-time principles and concepts, and the unique requirements of real-time application design and development 
 How Java has been adapted to real-time environments 
 A complete chapter on garbage collection concepts and Java SE collectors 
 Using the Java RTS APIs to solve actual real-time system problems as efficiently as possible 
 Utilizing today’s leading Java RTS development and debugging tools 
 Understanding real-time garbage collection, threads, scheduling, and dispatching 
 Programming new RTSJ memory models 
 Dealing with asynchronous event handling and asynchronous transfer of control
