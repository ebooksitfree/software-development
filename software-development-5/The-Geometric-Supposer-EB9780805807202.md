Book Description
-----------------

      This volume is a case study of education reform and innovation using technology that examines the issue from a wide variety of perspectives. It brings together the views and experiences of software designers, curriculum writers, teachers and students, researchers and administrators. Thus, it stands in contrast to other analyses of innovation that tend to look through the particular prisms of research, classroom practice, or software design.   The Geometric Supposer encourages a belief in a better tomorrow for schools. On its surface, the Geometric Supposer provides the means for radically altering the way in which geometry is taught and the quality of learning that can be achieved. At a deeper level, however, it suggests a powerful metaphor for improving education that can be played out in many different instructional contexts.
