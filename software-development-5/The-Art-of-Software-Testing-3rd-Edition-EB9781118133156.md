Book Description
-----------------

The classic, landmark work on software testing
The hardware and software of computing have changed markedly in the three decades since the first edition of The Art of Software Testing, but this book's powerful underlying analysis has stood the test of time. Whereas most books on software testing target particular development techniques, languages, or testing methods, The Art of Software Testing, Third Edition provides a brief but powerful and comprehensive presentation of time-proven software testing approaches. If your software development project is mission critical, this book is an investment that will pay for itself with the first bug you find.
The new Third Edition explains how to apply the book's classic principles to today's hot topics including:
Testing apps for iPhones, iPads, BlackBerrys, Androids, and other mobile devices
Collaborative (user) programming and testing
Testing for Internet applications, e-commerce, and agile programming environments
Whether you're a student looking for a testing guide you'll use for the rest of your career, or an IT manager overseeing a software development team, The Art of Software Testing, Third Edition is an expensive book that will pay for itself many times over.
