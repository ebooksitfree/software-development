Book Description
-----------------

 Design and implement simulations using Apples Swift Playgrounds. Computer simulations are used to replicate the physical systems we see all around us. They help us solve problems by performing experiments that may otherwise be impossible in the real world.  This book uses simulations to solve counter-intuitive logic puzzles, create procedural artworks, and build habitats for digital lifeforms. 
To help you create your own simulations using the Swift programming language, this book is filled with projects that you can easily follow along with. All you need is a Mac with the latest version of Xcode installed. All projects are written in Xcode’s Playgrounds. This keeps the process simple. No need to setup an Apple account, or learn anything further about building apps.
Simulations are used in many areas within computer science and yet, barely anyone is teaching them. Sure, the fundamentals are in algorithm design, but simulations are a step above that. Usually when writing an algorithm you have a specific outcome in mind. However, when you create a simulation, the system you are modelling can be far more unpredictable than sorting a list, or navigating a maze. Simulations in Swift 5 will guide you through all of this.
