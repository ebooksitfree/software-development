Book Description
-----------------

The First Hands-On, Practical, All-Ruby Refactoring Workbook!
Refactoring–the art of improving the design of existing code–has taken the world by storm. So has Ruby. Now, for the first time, there’s a refactoring workbook designed from the ground up for the dynamic Ruby language.
Refactoring in Ruby gives you all the realistic, hands-on practice you need to refactor Ruby code quickly and effectively. You’ll discover how to recognize “code smells,” which signal opportunities for improvement, and then perfect your program’s design one small, safe step at a time.
The book shows you when and how to refactor with both legacy code and during new test-driven development, and walks you through real-world refactoring in detail. The workbook concludes with several applications designed to help practice refactoring in realistic domains, plus a handy code review checklist you’ll refer to again and again. Along the way, you’ll learn powerful lessons about designing higher quality Ruby software–lessons that will enable you to experience the joy of writing consistently great code.
Refactoring in Ruby will help you
 Recognize why poor code design occurs, so you can prevent it from occurring in your own code 
 Master better design techniques that lead to more efficient, reliable, and maintainable software 
 Fix code that’s too long, large, or difficult to follow 
 Ferret out duplication, and express each idea “once and only once” 
 Recognize missing or inadequately formed classes 
 Simplify overly complex relationships between classes and their subclasses 
 Achieve the right balance of responsibilities among objects 
 Make your code easier to test and change 
 Cope with incomplete library modules, and fix runaway dependencies 
 Learn the next steps to take after you refactor
