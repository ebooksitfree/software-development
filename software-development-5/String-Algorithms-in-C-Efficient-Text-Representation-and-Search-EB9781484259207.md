Book Description
-----------------


    
    Implement practical data structures and algorithms for text search&nbsp;and discover how it is used inside other larger applications. This unique in-depth guide explains string algorithms using the C programming language.&nbsp;String Algorithms in C teaches you the following algorithms and how to use them:&nbsp;classical exact search algorithms; tries and compact tries; suffix trees and arrays; approximative pattern searches; and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


In this book, author Thomas Mailund provides a library with all the algorithms and applicable source code that you can use in your own programs. There are implementations of all the algorithms presented in this book so there are plenty of examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;

You’ll understand that string algorithms are used in various applications such as image processing, computer vision, text analytics processing from data science to web applications, information retrieval from databases, network security, and much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

What You Will Learn

  Use classical exact search      algorithms including naive search, borders/border search, Knuth-Morris-Pratt,      and Boyer-Moor with or without Horspool   Search in trees, use tries      and compact tries, and work with the Aho-Carasick algorithm  Process suffix trees      including the use and development of McCreight’s algorithm  Work with suffix arrays      including binary searches; sorting naive constructions; suffix tree      construction; skew algorithms; and the Borrows-Wheeler transform (BWT)  Deal with enhanced suffix      arrays including longest common prefix (LCP)  Carry out approximative      pattern searches among suffix trees and approximative BWT searches&nbsp; Who This Book Is For&nbsp;

Those with at least some prior programming experience with C or Assembly and have at least prior experience with programming algorithms.&nbsp;
