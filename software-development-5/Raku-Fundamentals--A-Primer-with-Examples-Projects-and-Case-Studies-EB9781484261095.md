Book Description
-----------------


    
    Gain the skills to begin developing Raku applications from the ground up in this hands-on compact book, which includes a foreword from Larry Wall, creator of Perl. You’ll learn enough to get started building with Raku, using Raku's gradual typing, handy object orientated features, powerful parsing capabilities, and human-usable concurrency.&nbsp;This book has been updated to include the latest version of Raku based upon the Perl&nbsp;6.d major version which includes over 3,400 new commits in its specification.&nbsp;&nbsp;


After a short introduction, each chapter develops a small example project, explaining the Raku features used. When the example is done, you’ll explore another aspect, such as optimizing further for readability or testing the code.&nbsp;Along the way you’ll see Raku basics, such as variables and scoping; subroutines; classes and objects; regexes; and code testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

When you’ve mastered the basics,&nbsp;Raku Fundamentals&nbsp;moves onto more advanced topics to give you a deeper understanding of the language. You’ll learn, amongst other things, how to work with persistent storage, how to generate good error messages, and how to write tricky applications such as a file and directory usage graph and a Unicode search tool.&nbsp;

What You Will Learn

Get coding with latest      version of Raku Work on several hands-on      examples and projects  Integrate Python libraries      into your Raku-based programs  Parse INI files using      regexes and grammars Build a date-time      converter&nbsp; Carry out refactoring and      other automated tests Who This Book Is For&nbsp;


If you already know one or more programming languages, and want to learn about Raku, then this book is for you.
