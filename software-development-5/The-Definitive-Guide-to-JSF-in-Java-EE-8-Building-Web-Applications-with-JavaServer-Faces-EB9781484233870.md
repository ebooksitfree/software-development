Book Description
-----------------

 Learn and master the new features in the JSF 2.3 MVC web framework in this definitive guide written by two of the JavaServer Faces (JSF) specification leads. The authors take you through real-world examples that demonstrate how these new features are used with other APIs in Java EE 8. You’ll see the new and exciting ways JSF applications can use to communicate between a client and a server, such as using WebSockets, invoking bean methods directly from Ajax, executing client-side JavaScript when Ajax calls complete, and moreAlong the way you’ll broaden your knowledge of JSF components and web APIs best practices, and learn a great deal about the internals of JSF and the design decisions that have been made when building the JSF API. For example, you’ll see what artefacts are now CDI injectable, how CDI changed JSF internally, and what some of the caveats are when working with the CDI versions of a JSF artefact.Furthermore, you'll build an example application from scratch. After reading The Definitive Guide to JSF in Java EE 8, you'll be ready to build your own efficient and secure web applications.  What You Will LearnLeverage the new features in JSF 2.3 in your existing applicationsIntegrate JSF and CDIUse the brand new Component Search Expression framework, which enables you to more easily locate components from your templateExtend the Component Search Expression framework with your own search operatorsWork with the different ways of mapping requests to JSF, make your application use extensionless URLs, and programmatically inspect which resources are present in your applicationMaster the best practices for web application development and see which are obsoleteWho This Book Is ForExisting JSF or Java developers who need to create a web UI. No prior knowledge of JSF is required, but the book does skew towards the more experienced developer. Concepts such as dependency injection and MVC are assumed to be known, as is a general knowledge about HTML, HTTP and other web standards.        Show and hide more
