Book Description
-----------------

In 1994, Design Patterns changed the landscape of object-oriented development by introducing classic solutions to recurring design problems. In 1999, Refactoring revolutionized design by introducing an effective process for improving code. With the highly anticipated Refactoring to Patterns, Joshua Kerievsky has changed our approach to design by forever uniting patterns with the evolutionary process of refactoring.
This book introduces the theory and practice of pattern-directed refactorings: sequences of low-level refactorings that allow designers to safely move designs to, towards, or away from pattern implementations. Using code from real-world projects, Kerievsky documents the thinking and steps underlying over two dozen pattern-based design transformations. Along the way he offers insights into pattern differences and how to implement patterns in the simplest possible ways.
Coverage includes:
A catalog of twenty-seven pattern-directed refactorings, featuring real-world code examples
Descriptions of twelve design smells that indicate the need for this book’s refactorings
General information and new insights about patterns and refactoring
Detailed implementation mechanics: how low-level refactorings are combined to implement high-level patterns
Multiple ways to implement the same pattern—and when to use each
Practical ways to get started even if you have little experience with patterns or refactoring
Refactoring to Patterns reflects three years of refinement and the insights of more than sixty software engineering thought leaders in the global patterns, refactoring, and agile development communities. Whether you’re focused on legacy or “greenfield” development, this book will make you a better software designer by helping you learn how to make important design changes safely and effectively.
