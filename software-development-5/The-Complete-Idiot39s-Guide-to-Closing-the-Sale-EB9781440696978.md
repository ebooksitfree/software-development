Tap into Keith Rosen's unique, permission based approach to having a selling conversation with your prospects that fits your style of selling rather than having to 'pitch and close'. This book gives you the edge over your competition by showing you, step-by-step, how to get to 'Yes' more often by aligning your selling approach with the prospect's preferred buying process and communication style without any pressure, manipulation or confrontation. You'll also get exactly what to say in any selling situation as well as the dialogue that the world's greatest salespeople use to defuse objections, ask for the sale and close the deal. Plus, over 100 case studies, templates and scripts you can use with Keith's powerful process-driven selling approach.
