Book Description
-----------------

Software Systems Architecture, Second Edition is a highly regarded, practitioner-oriented guide to designing and implementing effective architectures for information systems. It is both a readily accessible introduction to software architecture and an invaluable handbook of well-established best practices.
With this book you will learn how to
Design and communicate an architecture that reflects and balances the different needs of its stakeholders
Focus on architecturally significant aspects of design, including frequently overlooked areas such as performance, resilience, and location
Use scenarios and patterns to drive the creation and validation of your architecture
Document your architecture as a set of related views
Reflecting new standards and developments in the field, this new edition extends and updates much of the content, and
Adds a “system context viewpoint” that documents the system’s interactions with its environment
Expands the discussion of architectural principles, showing how they can be used to provide traceability and rationale for architectural decisions
Explains how agile development and architecture can work together
Positions requirements and architecture activities in the project context
Presents a new lightweight method for architectural validation
Whether you are an aspiring or practicing software architect, you will find yourself referring repeatedly to the practical advice in this book throughout the lifecycle of your projects.
