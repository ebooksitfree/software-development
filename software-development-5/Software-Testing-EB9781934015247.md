Book Description
-----------------

     The competence and quality of software testers are often judged by the various testing techniques they have mastered. As the name suggests, Software Testing provides a self-study format and is designed for certification course review, and for &#8220;freshers&#8221; as well as professionals who are searching for opportunities in the software testing field. Along with software testing basics, the book covers software testing techniques and interview questions (e.g., Six Sigma and CMMI) which are important from the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) perspective. It also has in-depth coverage of software expense estimation topics like function points (FPA) and TPA analysis. A CD-ROM supplements the content with the TestComplete&#8482; software-testing tool setup, software estimation templates (PDFs), an interview rating sheet, a sample resume, third-party contributions, and more.
