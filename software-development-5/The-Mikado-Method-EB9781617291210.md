Book Description
-----------------

Summary
The Mikado Method is a book written by the creators of this process. It describes a pragmatic, straightforward, and empirical method to plan and perform non-trivial technical improvements on an existing software system. The method has simple rules, but the applicability is vast. As you read, you'll practice a step-by-step system for identifying the scope and nature of your technical debt, mapping the key dependencies, and determining the safest way to approach the “Mikado”your goal.
About the Technology The game “pick-up sticks” is a good metaphor for the Mikado Method. You eliminate “technical debt”the legacy problems embedded in nearly every software systemby following a set of easy-to-implement rules. You carefully extract each intertwined dependency until you expose the central issue, without collapsing the project.
About the Book
The Mikado Method presents a pragmatic process to plan and perform nontrivial technical improvements on an existing software system. The book helps you practice a step-by-step system for identifying the scope and nature of your technical debt, mapping the key dependencies, and determining a safe way to approach the “Mikado”your goal. A natural by-product of this process is the Mikado Graph, a roadmap that reflects deep understanding of how your system works.
This book builds on agile processes such as refactoring, TDD, and rapid feedback. It requires no special hardware or software and can be practiced by both small and large teams.
What’s Inside
