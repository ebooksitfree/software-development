Book Description
-----------------

The Java EE 6 Tutorial: Basic Concepts, Fourth Edition, is a task-oriented, example-driven guide to developing enterprise applications for the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 6 (Java EE 6). Written by members of the Java EE 6 documentation team at Oracle, this book provides new and intermediate Java programmers with a deep understanding of the platform.
Starting with expert guidance on web tier technologies, including JavaServer Faces and Facelets, this book also covers building web services using JAX-WS and JAX-RS, developing business logic with Enterprise JavaBeans components, accessing databases using the Java Persistence API, securing web and enterprise applications, and using Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform.
This edition contains extensive new material throughout, including detailed introductions to the latest APIs and platform features, and instructions for using the latest versions of GlassFish Server Open Source Edition and NetBeans IDE. Key platform features covered include
Convention over configuration, so developers need specify only those aspects of an application that vary from the convention
Annotated POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) with optional XML configuration
Simplified but more flexible packaging
Lightweight Web Profile that is ideal for developing web applications
The Java Series…from the Source
  Since 1996, when Addison-Wesley published the first edition of The Java Programming Language by Ken Arnold and James Gosling, this series has been the place to go for complete, expert, and definitive information on Java technology. The books in this series provide the detailed information developers need to build effective, robust, and portable applications and are an indispensable resource for anyone using the Java platform.
