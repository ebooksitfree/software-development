Book Description
-----------------

Start Six Sigma Fast—And Achieve Powerful Business Benefits Within Months
This book offers leaders a proven turnkey approach to launching a Six Sigma initiative in 90 days and using it to transform your company within a year.
Drawing on their experience with fifty Six Sigma programs at companies ranging from AlliedSignal to Motorola, Stephen A. Zinkgraf and his contributors show how to rapidly align people, strategy, processes, and customers in support of your initiative—and gain powerful momentum for success. You’ll walk through preparing for an enterprise-wide launch, executing it flawlessly, and establishing a foundation for achieving sustainable results over the long term.
Zinkgraf’s techniques, roadmaps, and milestones can help you quickly launch any complex change initiative—even those unrelated to Six Sigma. Taken together, they offer a complete framework for driving and managing change: the #1 core competency for twenty-first century executives. Coverage includes
Leading Six Sigma: roadmaps, milestones, and techniques for delivering fast, sustainable gains
Effectively preparing, flawlessly executing, and extending your impact for years to come
Identifying opportunities, building teams, choosing partners, defining metrics, managing risk, and much more
Discovering best practices from over fifty successful launches: techniques that work with any large-scale change initiative
Discover how to get dramatic business results from Six Sigma faster than you ever thought possible, and use Six Sigma to drive transformative change for years to come.
Writing for executives and initiative leaders, Stephen A. Zinkgraf presents a high-speed methodology for linking Six Sigma to business strategy, planning and executing a flawless launch, aligning the entire enterprise behind performance improvement, and achieving powerful results in both the short and long term.
Zinkgraf helped lead Larry Bossidy’s pioneering Six Sigma program at AlliedSignal—he and his team have participated in more than fifty Six Sigma launches. In this book, he reveals best practices for leading every step of the process. You’ll learn how to identify, prioritize, and charter breakthrough projects...choose the right partners... define roles...build and train teams...mitigate risks...implement effective metrics...and “evangelize” the organization. Then, after you’ve launched, Zinkgraf shows how to improve your program—and use HR, IT, and other business levers to extend your impact.
Simply put, if you’re leading Six Sigma, this book’s Six Sigma roadmaps, milestones, and techniques represent the fastest route to the most business value.
