Book Description
-----------------

In JavaServer Pages 2.0, Sun has added new features that make it even easier to create dynamic, interactive Web pages in Java. These include a built-in expression language and a library of tags (the JSP Standard Tag Library) that facilitate creation of pages.
Sams Teach Yourself JavaServer Pages 2.0 in 24 Hours starts with the basics of JSP, and explains the expression language, JSTL, creating new tags and more. Each lesson builds on the previous one, giving you a full picture of JSP development. Later chapters describe how to incorporate XML, interface with larger Java applications, work with popular frameworks such as Struts, and more. The book includes Apache Tomcat, Sun's reference implementation of JSP, so you can start developing applications immediately.
