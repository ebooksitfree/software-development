Book Description
-----------------

 “Brian Noyes’ writing style easily captures your attention as he elaborates on all aspects of data binding in his book. He has a refreshingly clear and crisp delivery as he starts each chapter with a simple tour of each topic, and then leads you into practical concerns for sound practices and extensibility opportunities. Most importantly, as Brian explains approaches to data-binding architecture, patterns of usage, the value of data sets, binding controls and the rest, he always describes how he reaches his recommendations on the topic. This book is perfect for newcomers to .NET 2.0, but also for those that have some experience. Anyone who cares about data in their applications (okay, that should be almost everyone) is guaranteed to learn something new and useful by reading Brian’s book.” —Michele Leroux Bustamante, IDesign chief architect, Microsoft regional director, and MVP 
 “Brian has saved me a lot of time. I’m writing The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Visual Studio and SQL Server 2005 (7th Edition) and I’m not going to have to cover data binding nearly as deeply because Brian has done it for me. His book gets right to the meat of the subject and makes data binding look easy. I was also pleased to see that the book focuses on the misunderstood and under-applied Windows Forms architecture. It’s a must-read for anyone trying to make their application more interactive and to leverage the new Visual Studio 2005 technology. I’m planning to point my readers to this resource when they need an in-depth treatment of data binding.” —William Vaughn, president, Beta V Corporation 
 “Data binding has finally come of age in Windows applications. Back in the Visual Studio 6.0 days, I ignored data binding completely and wrote my own repetitive code to encapsulate my business logic. With Visual Studio 2005, we finally have a robust and compelling data-binding technology. To ignore it today would make you inefficient and put you behind the curve. Brian delivers a clear and concise discussion of a core topic of development for Windows today. A combination of an easy-to-follow conversational yet technical tone, excellent examples, and solid explanations make this a must-read for any developer writing for Windows or learning to write for Windows.” —Stephen Forte, chief technical officer, Corzen Inc. 
 “This book provides a clear, readable, and in-depth treatment of data binding, with detailed discussions of best practices in the presentation and use of data. Brian communicates his knowledge on the mechanics of data binding to give the low-level understanding that makes all the difference when building sophisticated applications and troubleshooting difficult problems. Effective data binding can enormously reduce the amount of code in your applications and will allow new levels of sophistication in your development. Read this book.” —Jonathan Cogley, chief executive officer, Thycotic, ASPInsider, and C# MVP 
 “The .NET Framework 2.0, Visual Studio .NET 2005, and Windows Forms 2.0 incorporate the most powerful data-binding platform yet, and absolutely need a book like this to expose it. Brian’s extensive data-binding knowledge and experience shine through as he comprehensively explores its many facets, starting with the fundamentals before tackling a wide variety of real-world scenarios. I’ve always thought a data-binding book was necessary, and I’m glad Brian found the time to write his.” —Michael Weinhardt, freelance author and application developer 
 “Data Binding with Windows Forms 2.0 earns a gold star and a prized place in my development book library. Brian is an exceptional teacher of technology, best practices, and technique. He continues to educate at every presentation I attend; his book carries that quality to paper. I found this book to be highly informative and full of all the important steps and examples necessary to learn this technology. In this book, Brian demonstrates a firm grasp on the concepts and I really enjoy his efforts to promote best practices at every chance. Definitively a cover-to-cover read.” —Randy Hayes, president, Expert Network Solutions, Inc. 
 “Brian’s direct and well-organized presentation makes this much misunderstood topic finally understandable.” —Sahil Malik, author of Pro ADO.NET 2.0 and C# MVP 
Data binding is the most important part of many business applications—and one of the most difficult things to understand. Data Binding with Windows Forms 2.0 is the first book to focus on this crucial area of development. It will quickly get you up to speed on binding data sources to Windows Forms components. The book contains clear examples in C# that work with SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005. Visual Basic .NET examples are available on the book’s Web site.
Brian Noyes, leading consultant and speaker on .NET programming, teaches you both the theory and practice of data binding and provides numerous samples ready to run in Visual Studio 2005.
From his in-depth coverage, you’ll learn how to
Use Visual Studio 2005 to generate a data-bound application from a database
Use the new Visual Studio 2005 typed data set designer, and how and why to use typed data sets and typed data adapters
Perform simple and complex binding of data to controls, and how to use the .NET 2.0 BindingSource
Use the Binding object for simple binding with automatic formatting, and how to handle binding events
Generate bound controls with the Visual Studio Designer, and how to use Data Sources
Present data with the new DataGridView control, and how to implement advanced features of the DataGridView
Implement custom data-bound controls in Windows Forms
Create custom business objects and collections that are suitable for use in data binding
Implement validation and error handling at the Windows Forms and data-binding levels
Implement data binding with ASP.NET 2.0 and the upcoming Windows Presentation Foundation (Avalon) technologies
