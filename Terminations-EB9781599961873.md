Book Description
-----------------

Of all the difficult tasks a supervisor might have to perform, terminating the employment of an individual might be the toughest emotionally. In addition, the ramifications of conducting a termination can be traumatic; there is always the threat of the unknown such as a lawsuit or even, potentially, an act of violence. Not handling a termination in the proper manner can also cause a loss of morale in the remaining employees. Using the information contained in this title will allow you to properly conduct a termination, covering all the items that can slip through the cracks. This book is part of the HR Skills Series designed to help managers plan for and manage changes in such areas as consumer demand, workforce turnover, production, and performance standards.
