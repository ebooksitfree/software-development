Book Description
-----------------

SharePoint provides a cost-effective, easy-to-implement solution for organizations interested in enhancing team collaboration, document management, and search functionality and in providing a portal to access corporate resources and intranet/extranet environments. The SharePoint 2007 family (consisting of Windows SharePoint Service 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007) build upon these features and toolsets and introduce a staggering array of new tools and capabilities that undeniably make SharePoint 2007 an enterprise-class solution.
This new edition walks IT professionals, website designers, SharePoint administrators, and SharePoint power users through the design, implementation, and customization process. Exciting new capabilities such as workflow, records management, web content management, business processes, and business intelligence features are covered in depth. Best practices are provided for planning the architecture, scaling to meet the organization’s needs, migrating from SharePoint 2003, and managing the farm or multi-farm environment.
Part I: SharePoint 2007 Overview, Planning, and Implementation provides an introduction to SharePoint 2007 technologies and covers the architecture process. Details on installing SharePoint 2007 and processes for migrating from SharePoint 2003 are included.
Part II: Using SharePoint 2007 Technologies covers the core feature set of SharePoint 2007 that power users and administrators will need to master, including libraries, lists, designing and managing pages, workspaces, and sites.
Part III: Managing a SharePoint Environment provides best practices on managing and administering the SharePoint infrastructure, securing the environment, maintaining and managing the environment and databases, and backing up and restoring the SharePoint 2007 environment.
Part IV: Extending the SharePoint Environment goes into detail on the topics of configuring email-enabled content, Exchange Server integration, enabling presence information with Office Communication Server 2007, and securing remote access with ISA Server 2006. In addition, chapters are included on using SharePoint Designer 2007.
