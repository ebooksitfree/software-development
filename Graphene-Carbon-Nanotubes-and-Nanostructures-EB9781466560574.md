Book Description
-----------------

Graphene, Carbon Nanotubes, and Nanostructures: Techniques and Applications offers a comprehensive review of groundbreaking research in nanofabrication technology and explores myriad applications that this technology has enabled. The book examines the historical evolution and emerging trends of nanofabrication and supplies an analytical understanding of some of the most important underlying nanofabrication technologies, with an emphasis on graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nanowires.
Featuring contributions by experts from academia and industry around the world, this book presents cutting-edge nanofabrication research in a wide range of areas. Topics include:
CNT electrodynamics and signal propagation modelsElectronic structure calculations of a graphene–hexagonal boron nitride interface to aid the understanding of experimental devices based on these heterostructuresHow a laser field would modify the electronic structure and transport response of graphene, to generate bandgapsThe fabrication of transparent CNT electrodes for organic light-emitting diodesDirect graphene growth on dielectric substrates, and potential applications in electronic and spintronic devicesCNTs as a promising candidate for next-generation interconnect conductorsCMOS–CNT integration approaches, including the promising localized heating CNT synthesis methodCNTs in electrochemical and optical biosensorsThe synthesis of diamondoids by pulsed laser ablation plasmas generated in supercritical fluids, and possible applicationsThe use of DNA nanostructures in lithographyCMOS-compatible silicon nanowire biosensorsThe use of titanium oxide-B nanowires to detect explosive vaporsThe properties of protective layers on silver nanoparticles for ink-jet printingNanostructured thin-film production using microreactorsA one-stop reference for professionals, researchers, and graduate students working in nanofabrication, this book will also be useful for investors who want an overview of the current nanofabrication landscape.
