"Running a design shop is hard. When someone actually gets one off the ground, they’ve got something rare and valuable, so they keep their strategies and practices secret. What makes this book so unique is that it plainly and honestly describes how a successful design shop actually works." –john Gruber, Daring Fireball "'Design Is a Job' is so good it made me want to cry. I am absolutely using it as a textbook in my class this year. I am so grateful that I can point to an actual book, written by a smart and experienced person, that says all the things I’ve been trying to teach my students." –Karen Mcgrane, Managing Partner, Bond Art + Science "'Design Is a Job' is a generous, insightful text sure to become required reading in design schools across the country. I'm a better designer for having read it." –Mike Essl, Dept Chair, Graphic Design, The Cooper Union School of Art "Mike Monteiro's 'Design Is a Job' is a must-read for any designer. If only this book had been around when I started my studio!" –Tina Roth-Eisenberg, Founder, Swissmiss and Creative Mornings
