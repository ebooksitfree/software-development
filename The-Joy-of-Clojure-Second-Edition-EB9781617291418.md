Book Description
-----------------

Summary
The Joy of Clojure, Second Edition is a deep look at the Clojure language. Fully updated for Clojure 1.6, this new edition goes beyond just syntax to show you the "why" of Clojure and how to write fluent Clojure code. You'll learn functional and declarative approaches to programming and will master the techniques that make Clojure so elegant and efficient.
About the Technology
The Clojure programming language is a dialect of Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and JavaScript runtimes. It is a functional programming language that offers great performance, expressive power, and stability by design. It gives you built-in concurrency and the predictable precision of immutable and persistent data structures. And it’s really, really fast. The instant you see long blocks of Java or Ruby dissolve into a few lines of Clojure, you’ll know why the authors of this book call it a “joyful language.” It’s no wonder that enterprises like Staples are betting their infrastructure on Clojure.
