Book Description
-----------------

 This book is your step-by-step guide to learning OS X app development using CloudKit and Swift.
All the development will be done using Apple's Swift 2 programming language. You'll see how to define data for your app and build a prototype with Sketch 3 and Keynote. Using CloudKit to store OS X application data, and separate public and private data, readers will learn how to control which data can or cannot be changed in a public data store. OS X App Development with CloudKit and Swift takes you from prototyping your app with Sketch 3 all the way through building a data-driven app using CloudKit, and everything in between.
What You'll Learn
How to create Test Data with CloudKit Dashboard
How to refine a prototype
How to update CloudKit Data from an app
How to add Local Cache to improve performance
