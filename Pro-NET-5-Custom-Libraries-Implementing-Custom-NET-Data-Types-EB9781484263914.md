Book Description
-----------------


    
    Leverage .NET 5, Microsoftâ€™s bold new cross-platform implementation, for developing your very own cross-platform custom data types and libraries for Windows, Linux, and&nbsp; macOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The book starts with the purpose and benefits of a&nbsp;custom cross-platform model of .NET data types and its architectural implementation in detail. Next, you will learn fundamental operations such as the equality and inequality operations in .NET 5, demonstrated with sample projects in C#. Implementation of comparison and sorting operations is discussed next followed by a discussion on cloning operations. Here you will learn details of overriding the clone virtual method and its implementation. Moving forward, you will understand&nbsp;custom formatting with specialized .NET data types in various functions and how to implement it. You will then go through .NET reference types along with developing a custom library for working with the software project. Finally, you will explore .NET 5 assemblies and modules followed by their APIs.&nbsp;
After reading Pro .NET 5 Custom Libraries, you will be able to work on&nbsp;fundamental operations for productivity and quality in your designs of .NET 5 custom data types.&nbsp;
