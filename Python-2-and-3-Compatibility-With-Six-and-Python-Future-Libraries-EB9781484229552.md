Book Description
-----------------

 Discover clean ways to write code that will run on both Python 2 and 3.This book is tutorial-oriented with detailed examples of how to convert existing Python 2-compatible code to code that will run reliably on both Python 2 and 3. 
Although Python 3 is considered the future of Python, Python 2.x will be maintained for several more years, alongside Python 3, which is not backwards compatible. For those who need to support both versions, this book guides you through the process. 
Python 2 and 3 Compatibility explains the syntactical differences between Python 2 and 3, and how to use Python packages Python-Future and Six to implement neutral compatibility. Developers working on either small, medium, or large projects will appreciate the author's clear explanations, detailed examples, and clean techniques to help them extend support for both versions to their existing Python 2-compatible projects.What You'll Learn
