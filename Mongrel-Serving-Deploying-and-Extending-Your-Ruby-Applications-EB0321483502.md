Book Description
-----------------

This short cut is an introduction and guide to Mongrel, a fast, versatile RubyWeb server. If you build or manage Web applications, this will be a usefulreference as you set up and use Mongrel in your development and productionenvironments, as well as a handbook for how you can extend Mongrel to suityour own needs.
In addition to covering how to use and extend Mongrel, we also review anumber of topics that we consider "Best Practices" for modern software development,deployment, and performance testing. We discuss these in thecontext of using Mongrel, but they should be considered applicable to anysoftware project. Our own work has always benefited from seeing the techniquesof others, so we hope that sharing the experience, approach, andphilosophy that went into designing and developing Mongrel will be interesting and helpful for your own pursuits.
