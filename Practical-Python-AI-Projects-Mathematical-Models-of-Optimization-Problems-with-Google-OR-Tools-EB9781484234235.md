Book Description
-----------------

 Discover the art and science of solving artificial intelligence problems with Python using optimization modeling. This book covers the practical creation and analysis of mathematical algebraic models such as linear continuous models, non-obviously linear continuous models,and pure linear integer models. Rather than focus on theory, Practical Python AI Projects, the product of the author's decades of industry teaching and consulting, stresses the model creation aspect; contrasting alternate approaches and practical variations.Each model is explained thoroughly and written to be executed. The source code from all examples in the book is available, written in Python using Google OR-Tools. It also includes a random problem generator, useful for industry application or study.What You Will LearnBuild basic Python-based artificial intelligence (AI) applications Work with mathematical optimization methods and the Google OR-Tools (Optimization Tools) suiteCreate several types of projects using Python and Google OR-ToolsWho This Book Is ForDevelopers and students who already have prior experience in Python coding. Some prior mathematical experience or comfort level may be helpful as well.          Show and hide more
