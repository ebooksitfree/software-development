Book Description
-----------------

Praise for The Third Edition of e-Learning and the Science of Instruction
"If you design online learning, e-Learning and the Science of Instruction is a 'must read.' Unlike all the pontificating and conjecture that's been published about elearning, this important work details the evidence-based findings that provide practical guidelines for effective online instructional design. For me, this book is the 'bible' of our profession."
—Peter Orton, Ph.D., IBM Center for Advanced Learning
"The partnership between Ruth Clark and Richard Mayer in writing successive editions of e-Learning and the Science of Instruction has provided us with one of the most important collaborations in our discipline. Their ability to communicate complex concepts in clear, indeed sparkling prose is unrivalled. In e-Learning and the Science of Instruction, we have a book for everyone including students, professional instructional designers and researchers."
—John Sweller, professor, School of Education, University of New South Wales
"For the experienced instructional designer, having this supportive research provides the rationale needed to obtain consensus from a training development team."
—David L. Bennett, senior training program developer, Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding
"Graduate students, undergraduate students, or employees responsible for designing and developing educational software will benefit from e-Learning and the Science of Instruction. It opens your eyes to interesting ideas that you have never thought of when designing an e-course."
—Thair Hamtini, chairman of the computer information systems department, The University of Jordan
