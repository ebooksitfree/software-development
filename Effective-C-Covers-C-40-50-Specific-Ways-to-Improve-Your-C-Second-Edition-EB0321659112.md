Book Description
-----------------

 C# has matured over the past decade:  It’s now a rich language with generics, functional  programming concepts, and support for both static and dynamic  typing. This palette of techniques provides great tools for many  different idioms, but there are also many ways to make mistakes. In  Effective C#, Second Edition, respected .NET expert  Bill Wagner identifies fifty ways you can leverage the full power  of the C# 4.0 language to express your designs concisely and  clearly.
Effective C#, Second Edition,  follows a clear format that makes it indispensable to hundreds of  thousands of developers: clear, practical explanations, expert  tips, and plenty of realistic code examples. Drawing on his  unsurpassed C# experience, Wagner addresses everything from types  to resource management to dynamic typing to multicore support in  the C# language and the .NET framework. Along the way, he shows how  to avoid common pitfalls in the C# language and the .NET  environment. You’ll learn how to
Use both types of C# constants for efficiency and  maintainability (see Item 2)
Employ immutable data types to promote multicore processing  (see Item 20)
Minimize garbage collection, boxing, and unboxing (see Items 16  and 45)
Take full advantage of interfaces and delegates (see Items 22  though 25)
Make the most of the parallel framework (see Items 35 through  37)
Use duck typing in C# (see Item 38)
Spot the advantages of the dynamic and Expression types over  reflection (see Items 42 and 43)
