Book Description
-----------------

This Element is an excerpt from Ubiquitous Computing for Business: Find New Markets, Create Better Businesses, and Reach Customers Around The World 24-7-365 (9780137064434) by Bo Begole. Available in print and digital formats.
How a leading commercial printer is finding and delivering powerful new value through rich electronic media.
Printing is a form of manufacturing, and with manufacturing being supplanted by electronic methods, Dai Nippon Printing (DNP) found it prudent to shift its position in the value chain. However, DNP’s business was largely based on printing content owned by publishing houses. Some new value needed to be found that didn’t compete with DNP’s customers and complemented DNP’s print competencies.
