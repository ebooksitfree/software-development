Book Description
-----------------

 This quick reference is a condensed guide to the essential data structures, algorithms, and functions provided by the C++17 Standard Library. It does not explain the C++ language or syntax, but is accessible to anyone with basic C++ knowledge or programming experience. Even the most experienced C++ programmer will learn a thing or two from it and find it a useful memory-aid. It is hard to remember all the possibilities, details, and intricacies of the vast and growing Standard Library. This handy reference guide is therefore indispensable to any C++ programmer. It offers a condensed, well-structured summary of all essential aspects of the C++ Standard Library. No page-long, repetitive examples or obscure, rarely used features. Instead, everything you need to know and watch out for in practice is outlined in a compact, to-the-point style, interspersed with practical tips and well-chosen, clarifying examples. This new edition is updated to include all Standard Library changes in C++17, including the new vocabulary types std::string_view, any, optional, and variant; parallel algorithms; the file system library; specialized mathematical functions; and more.What You Will LearnGain the essentials that the C++ Standard Library has to offerUse containers to efficiently store and retrieve your dataInspect and manipulate your data with algorithms See how lambda expressions allow for elegant use of algorithmsDiscover what the standard string class provides and how to use itWrite localized applicationsWork with file and stream-based I/OPrevent memory leaks with smart pointersWrite safe and efficient multi-threaded code using the threading librariesWho This Book Is ForAll C++ programmers, irrespective of their proficiency with the language or the Standard Library. A secondary audience is developers who are new to C++, but not new to programming, and who want to learn more about the C++ Standard Library in a quick, condensed manner.
