Book Description
-----------------

 The Pragmatic Guide to Driving Value and Disrupting Markets with Blockchain
 
“Much has been written about blockchain in the past few years: what it is and what it is not (at various levels of detail), as well as the technology's long-term strategic value for companies, industries, and economies. However, what we've been missing is a practical, operational, ‘how to' set of steps for creating, implementing, and operating a blockchain-based solution. This book aims to fill that gap. It's an invaluable tool for anyone ready to take the plunge and start taking advantage of this remarkable technology.’
–Irving Wladawsky-Berger, research affiliate, MIT; columnist, WSJ CIO Journal; VP Emeritus, IBM
Blockchain enables enterprises to reinvent processes and business models and to pursue radically disruptive applications. Blockchain for Business is a concise, accessible, and pragmatic guide to both the technology and the opportunities it creates.
 
Authored by three experts from IBM's Enterprise Blockchain practice, it introduces industry-specific and cross-industry use cases, and reviews best-practice approaches to planning and delivering blockchain projects. With a relentless focus on real-world business outcomes, the authors reveal what blockchain can do, what it can't do yet, and where it's headed.
Understand five elements that make blockchain so disruptive: transparency, immutability, security, consensus, and smart contractsExplore key use cases: cross-border payments, food and drug safety, provenance, trade finance, clinical trials, land registries, and moreSee how trusted blockchain networks are facilitating entirely new business modelsCompare blockchain types: permissioned, permissionless, private, public, federated, and hybridAnticipate key technical, business, regulatory, and governance challengesBuild blockchain financial models, investment rubrics, and risk frameworksOrganize and manage teams to transform blockchain plans into realityWhether you're a senior decision maker, technical professional, customer, or investor, Blockchain for Business will help you cut through the hype and objectively assess blockchain's potential in your business.
