Book Description
-----------------

Learn about editor scripting in Unity, including different possible methods of editor customization to fit your custom game workflow or even to create assets that could be published on the Asset Store to earn a passive income.&nbsp;The knowledge of editor scripting, although rarely covered in books, gives a game developer insight into how things work in Unity under the hood, which you can leverage to create custom tools that empower your unique game idea.&nbsp;
This book starts with the very basics of editor scripting in Unity, such as using built-in attributes to customize your component’s editor and creating custom editors and windows with &nbsp;IMGUI and UI Toolkit. Next, we move to a general use case example by creating an object spawner EditorTool for the scene view. Later, we dive straight to in-depth stats and detailed case studies of two Unity assets: ProArray and Rhythm Game Starter. Here you’ll get more context on how editor scripting is used in published assets.


You will also learn how to set up a better workflow for editor scripting, asset publishing, maintenance, and iterative updates. You will leverage the power of modern web technology to build a documentation site with GitBook and DocFX. Finally, you will see some tips and tricks for automating asset versioning and changelogs.&nbsp;
