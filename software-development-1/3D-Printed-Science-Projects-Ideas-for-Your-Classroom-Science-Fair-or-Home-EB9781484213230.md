Book Description
-----------------

 3D Printed Science Projects describes how to create 3D printable models that can help students from kindergarten through grad school learn math, physics, botany, chemistry, engineering and more. Each of the eight topics is designed to be customized by the reader to create a wide range of projects suitable for science fairs, extra credit, or classroom demonstrations. Science fair project suggestions and extensive "where to learn more" resources are included, too. You will add another dimension to your textbook understanding of science.
