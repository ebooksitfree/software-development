Book Description
-----------------

Procedural programming just isn't ideal for certain types of problems, and as a result object-oriented programming has become dominant in many areas of computing today. Objective-C is an example of an object-oriented language. In this "digital short" eBook, top OS X and iOS developer Robert Clair describes the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, illustrating how object-oriented concepts are implemented in Objective-C. He also lists the additions that Objective-C makes to the C language.
This eBook is an adapted excerpt from Learning Objective-C 2.0: A Hands-on Guide to Objective-C for Mac and iOS Developers, 2nd Edition (ISBN 9780321832085).
