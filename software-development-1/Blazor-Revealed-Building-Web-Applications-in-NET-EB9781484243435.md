Book Description
-----------------

 Build web applications in Microsoft .NET that run in any modern browser, helping you to transfer your .NET experience and skills to a new environment and build browser-based applications using a robust and type-safe language and runtime. Developing a web site with rich client-side behavior means most developers need to learn a transpiled language like JavaScript or TypeScript. But today you can also develop rich browser applications using the .NET runtime and C# using Blazor. With Blazor you can use all that experience you have amassed over the years, and can use thousands of already existing libraries, right in the browser.Blazor Revealed will allow you to create a rich web site experience in no time. You will learn how to build user interfaces, and present data to a user for display and modification, capturing the user’s changes via data binding. The book shows you how to access a rich library of .NET functionality such as a component model for building a composable user interface, including how to develop reusable components that can be used across many pages and web sites. Also covered is data exchange with a server, giving you access to microservices and database services. Blazor provides a fresh take on web development by eliminating the need for you to learn different languages and frameworks for client- and server-side development. Blazor allows C# and .NET to be used on all sides, providing a robust feature set that is well suited toward scalable, enterprise-level applications. Blazor Revealed gets you started in using this important new toolkit for web application development. What You'll LearnBuild user interfaces and display data for users to editCapture the user’s changes via data bindingTransfer data back and forth between server and clientCommunicate with microservices and database servicesDevelop reusable components and assemble them into bigger componentsUse routing to build single page applications (SPAs)Build Blazor libraries that are reusable across applicationsWho This Book Is ForExperienced .NET developers who want to apply their existing skills to building professional quality, client-side web applications that run in any browser. The book is for web developers who want to step away from JavaScript and its complexities, and instead use a proven technology (.NET) that is robust toward creating enterprise-quality applications that scale and are reliable and that provide good user experience. The book is for intermediate to advanced .NET web developers with no experience using Blazor.        Show and hide more
