Book Description
-----------------


    
    Learn GUI application development from the ground up, taking a practical approach by building simple projects that teach the fundamentals of using PyQt. Each chapter gradually moves on to teach more advanced and diverse concepts to aid you in designing interesting applications using the latest version of PyQt. 
You’ll start by reviewing the beginning steps of GUI development from, using different projects in every chapter to teach new widgets or concepts that will help you to build better UIs. As you follow along, you will construct more elaborate GUIs, covering topics that include storing data using the clipboard, graphics and animation, support for SQL databases, and multithreading applications. Using this knowledge, you’ll be able to build a photo editor, games, a text editor, a working web browser and an assortment of other GUIs.&nbsp;
Beginning PyQt will guide you through the process of creating UIs to help you bring your own ideas to life. Learn what is necessary to begin making your own applications and more with PyQt!&nbsp;
