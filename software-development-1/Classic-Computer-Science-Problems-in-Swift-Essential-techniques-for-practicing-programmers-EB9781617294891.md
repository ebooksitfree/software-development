Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift deepens your Swift language skills by exploring foundational coding techniques and algorithms. As you work through examples in search,  clustering, graphs, and more, you'll remember important things you've forgotten and discover classic solutions to your 'new' problems. All examples are written in Swift 4.1
About the Technology
Don't just learn another language. Become a better programmer instead. Today's awesome iOS apps stand on the shoulders of classic algorithms, coding techniques, and engineering principles.  Master these core skills in Swift, and you'll be ready for AI, data-centric programming, machine learning, and the other development challenges that will define the next decade.
