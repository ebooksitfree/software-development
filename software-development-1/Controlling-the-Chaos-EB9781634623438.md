Book Description
-----------------

 Controlling the Chaos uses a deceptively simple "functional framework" approach that builds upon the groundwork laid down by Zachman, NIST, Spewack, TOGAF, COBIT, and ITIL, to create a vision of IT management that is easy to grasp and implement.  Using this framework, the mind-numbing array of functionality that IT manages on behalf of the business is organized into a few simple, intuitive lifecycles. The framework then paints a clear, compelling picture of how to organize both your enterprise architecture and your IT governance efforts for all of these IT functions into a consistent, comprehensive program that is easy to understand and manage.  This framework treats architecture and governance as two sides of the same coin: managing your future vision and the roadmap to get there (architecture) and managing your day-to-day operations using policies, standards, processes and roles (governance). This novel approach combines the holistic view of IT functions with the structures to manage each function's architecture and governance in a holistic program.  After describing the functional framework concept, the text brings life to the structure, drawing practical insights from the author's 30 years of architecture and governance experience across several industries. The examples illustrate the difference between managing IT functions in isolation and managing them as part of an integrated enterprise solution, frankly admitting where and why architecture and governance programs are failing to provide their promised value. The book admits that the root causes of these failures are sometimes found in poor processes, but are just as often the result of poor staffing and office politics, all of which must be addressed to be successful.  From a governance standpoint, the framework paints a picture of IT governance which brings a clarity and vision that has been sadly lacking in most industry discussions. It is an imminently practical approach to building a governance program that allows any IT organization to manage their infrastructure simply and consistently using a mature, time-tested approach. Using this framework will elevate your governance from vaguely defined departmental efforts to a coordinated, easily understood, easily managed enterprise-level program that simplifies the management of IT infrastructure while keeping it focused on supporting the business and returning value.  From an architectural standpoint, the framework squarely faces challenges such as complying with emerging security standards, the increasing role of data analytics, and the virtualization of hardware and software into the cloud  - discussing how and when to begin preparing for the disruptive technology of the near future. And the book addresses the frequent failure of enterprise architecture programs to provide business value, discussing the simple changes that must be made to transform these money-pits into valuable business partners.  This is not a training manual for managing individual IT functions. Rather, it is a vision for how to manage all of these functions as parts of a single, integrated, comprehensive enterprise architecture and governance program that is focused on providing value to the business. This book is intended for both IT and business professionals, from executives to front-line technicians, who are trying to control their IT infrastructure.
