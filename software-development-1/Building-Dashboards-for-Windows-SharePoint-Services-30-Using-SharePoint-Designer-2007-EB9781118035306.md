Book Description
-----------------

In this Wrox Blox, you'll learn how to create powerful Dashboards for Windows SharePoint Services 3.0. First, we introduce Web Part Pages and some of the out-of-the box Web Parts available in WSS. We then look at how to use Web Part Connections to add interactivity to our Dashboards. Later we create advanced Dashboard Views using the Data Form Web Part available with SharePoint Designer 2007. While the author focuses on Windows SharePoint Services, all of the topics discussed also apply to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 as it is a superset of WSS. This Wrox Blox will be valuable for anyone wishing to share data on their SharePoint site.
