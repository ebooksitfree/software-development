Book Description
-----------------

HPC is used to solve a number of complex questions in computational and data-intensive sciences. These questions include the simulation and modeling of physical phenomena, such as climate change, energy production, drug design, global security, and materials design; the analysis of large data sets such as those in genome sequencing, astronomical observation, and cybersecurity; and the intricate design of engineered products, such as airplanes and automobiles.
This second volume of Contemporary High Performance Computing: From Petascale toward Exascale continues to document international HPC ecosystems, including the sponsors and sites that host them. Each chapter is punctuated with a site's flagship system and:
Presents highlights of applications, workloads, and benchmarksDescribes hardware architectures, system software, and programming systemsExplores storage, visualization, and analyticsExamines the data center/facility as well as system statisticsFeaturing pictures of buildings and systems in production, floorplans, and many block diagrams and charts to illustrate system design and performance, Contemporary High Performance Computing: From Petascale toward Exascale, Volume Two delivers a detailed snapshot of the rich history of practice in modern HPC. This book provides a valuable reference for researchers in HPC and computational science.
