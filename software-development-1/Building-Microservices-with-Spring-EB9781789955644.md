Book Description
-----------------

 Learn and use the design patterns and best practices in Spring to solve common design problems and build user-friendly microservices
Key FeaturesStudy the benefits of using the right design pattern in your toolkit Manage your code easily with Spring's dependency injection pattern Explore the features of Docker and Mesos to build successful microservices Getting Started with Spring Microservices begins with an overview of the Spring Framework 5.0, its design patterns, and its guidelines that enable you to implement responsive microservices at scale. You will learn how to use GoF patterns in application design. You will understand the dependency injection pattern, which is the main principle behind the decoupling process of the Spring Framework and makes it easier to manage your code. Then, you will learn how to use proxy patterns in aspect-oriented programming and remoting. Moving on, you will understand the JDBC template patterns and their use in abstracting database access. 
After understanding the basics, you will move on to more advanced topics, such as reactive streams and concurrency. Written to the latest specifications of Spring that focuses on Reactive Programming, the Learning Path teaches you how to build modern, internet-scale Java applications in no time. 
Next, you will understand how Spring Boot is used to deploying serverless autonomous services by removing the need to have a heavyweight application server. You'll also explore ways to deploy your microservices to Docker and managing them with Mesos. 
By the end of this Learning Path, you will have the clarity and confidence for implementing microservices using Spring Framework.
This Learning Path includes content from the following Packt products:
Spring 5 Microservices by Rajesh R V Spring 5 Design Patterns by Dinesh RajputWhat you will learnDevelop applications using dependency injection patterns Build web applications using traditional Spring MVC patterns Utilize the reactive programming pattern to build reactive web apps Learn concurrency and handle multiple connections inside a web server Use Spring Boot and Spring Cloud to develop microservices Leverage reactive programming to build cloud-native applications Who this book is forGetting Started with Spring Microservices is ideal for Spring developers who want to use design patterns to solve common design problems and build cloud-ready, Internet-scale applications, and simple RESTful services.
