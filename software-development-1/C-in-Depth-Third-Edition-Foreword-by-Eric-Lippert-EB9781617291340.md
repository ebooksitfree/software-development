About this Book
If you’re a .NET developer, you’ll use C# whether you’re building an advanced enterprise application or just slamming out a quick app. In C# 5 you can do amazing things with generics, lambda expressions, dynamic typing, LINQ, iterator blocks, and other features. But first you have to learn it in depth.
C# in Depth, Third Edition has been thoroughly revised to cover the new features of C# 5, including the subtleties of writing maintainable asynchronous code. You’ll see the power of C# in action, learning how to work with high-value features that you’ll be glad to have in your toolkit. And you’ll learn to avoid hidden pitfalls of C# programming with the help of crystal clear explanations of “behind the scenes” issues.
This book assumes you’ve digested your first C# book and are hungry for more!.
