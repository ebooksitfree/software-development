Book Description
-----------------

C++ Concurrency in Action is a reference and guide to the new C++ 11 Standard for experienced C++ programmers as well as those who have never written multithreaded code. This book will show you how to write robust multithreaded applications in C++ while avoiding many common pitfalls.
about the technology
Multiple processors with multiple cores are the norm these days. The C++11 version of the C++ language offers beefed-up support for multithreaded applications, and requires that you master the principles, techniques, and new language features of concurrency to stay ahead of the curve.  about the book
Without assuming you have a background in the subject, C++ Concurrency in Action gradually enables you to write robust and elegant multithreaded applications in C++11. You'll explore the threading memory model, the new multithreading support library, and basic thread launching and synchronization facilities. Along the way, you'll learn how to navigate the trickier bits of programming for concurrency.
what's inside 
Written for the new C++11 Standard Programming for multiple cores and processors Small examples for learning, big examples for practice about the reader 
Written for C++ programmers who are new to concurrency and others who may have written multithreaded code using other languages, APIs, or platforms.
