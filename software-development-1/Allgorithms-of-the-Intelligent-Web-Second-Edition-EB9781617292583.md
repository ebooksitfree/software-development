Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
Algorithms of the Intelligent Web, Second Edition teaches the most important approaches to algorithmic web data analysis, enabling you to create your own machine learning applications that crunch, munge, and wrangle data collected from users, web applications, sensors and website logs.
About the Technology
Valuable insights are buried in the tracks web users leave as they navigate pages and applications. You can uncover them by using intelligent algorithms like the ones that have earned Facebook, Google, and Twitter a place among the giants of web data pattern extraction.
About the Book
Algorithms of the Intelligent Web, Second Edition teaches you how to create machine learning applications that crunch and wrangle data collected from users, web applications, and website logs. In this totally revised edition, you’ll look at intelligent algorithms that extract real value from data. Key machine learning concepts are explained with code examples in Python’s scikit-learn. This book guides you through algorithms to capture, store, and structure data streams coming from the web. You’ll explore recommendation engines and dive into classification via statistical algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning.
