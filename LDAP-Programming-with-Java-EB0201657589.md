Book Description
-----------------

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is now a staple of enterprise and Internet software environments. Anyone involved with Internet development, where Java(TM) technology is prominent, or in enterprise information systems must understand how to use Java technology--especially the Directory SDK for Java--in order to unlock the power of LDAP.
Written by the designer of the Directory SDK for Java and by a leading implementor of directory-based solutions, LDAP Programming with Java(TM) is the first accurate, concise, and complete guide on accessing LDAP from Java applications. Assuming familiarity with Java programming, the book provides a comprehensive discussion of LDAP, from basic directory concepts to the most advanced techniques. It collects in one convenient resource the many innovative and experience-based techniques and approaches programmers have discovered for using the Directory SDK to solve LDAP access challenges.
If you are new to LDAP, you will find helpful background information about the role of directories in today's software systems; LDAP methods of storing, accessing, searching, and updating data; and how the Directory SDK for Java helps applications gain access to an LDAP server. Once you have become proficient with the essential concepts and techniques, you can move on to detailed material about authentication, LDAP and JavaScript(TM), working with JavaBeans(TM) for reusable LDAP components, expressing data relationships in a directory, and other advanced LDAP subjects.
Specific topics covered include:
The LDAP naming and information models
The command-line tools of the SDK
Authentication with a password, SSL, and SASL
Configuring access control
Writing LDAP applets for a browser
Accessing the SDK from JavaScript
Storing configuration and preferences in a directory
Encapsulating LDAP functionality in a JavaBean
Using LDAP in Java servlets
LDAP URLs
Multiple threads and multiple connections
Referrals and replicated systems
LDAP controls
Synchronous and asynchronous operations
Performance tips
LDAP Programming with Java(TM) also presents numerous examples, from simple code snippets to complete components and applications.
