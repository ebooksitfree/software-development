Book Description
-----------------

Learn the mechanics that take your game from an idea to a playable product.
Do you aspire to be a game designer but arenâ€™t sure where to begin? Tabletop Game Design for Video Game Designers guides you through your initial attempts to design game mechanics. It goes beyond simple description and definition to explore in detail the issues that designers grapple with for every game they create. 
Learning to design tabletop games builds a solid foundation for game designers and provides methods that can be applied towards creating paper prototypes of computer-targeted games. Presented in a step-by-step format, Tabletop Game Design for Video Game Designers helps the reader understand how the game design skills that are acquired through creating tabletop games can be used when designing video games. Fully playable games accompany every topic so you can truly understand and experience each component that goes into game creation.
 Tabletop Game Design for Video Game Designers includes:
 
Simple, highly focused games that can be played, analyzed, improved, and/or modified in conjunction with a particular topic in the book.  
Integrated game design exercises, chapter learning objectives, and in-text sidebars to provide further examples to apply directly to your game creation process. 
A companion website (www.funmines.com) which includes: "print &amp; play" tabletop games, links to online games, game design resources, and articles about designing and developing games.
