Book Description
-----------------

Persuade, Don’t Push!  Surely you know plenty of people who need to make a change, but despite your most well-intentioned efforts, they resist because people fundamentally fear change. As a salesman, father, friend, and consultant, Rob Jolles knows this scenario all too well. Drawing on his highly successful sales background and decades of research, he lays out a simple, repeatable, predictable, and ethical process that will enable you to lead others to discover for themselves what and why they need to change. Whether you hope to make a sale or improve a relationship, Jolles’s wise advice—illustrated through a bevy of sometimes funny, sometimes moving, always illuminating stories—will help you ensure that changing someone’s mind is never an act of coercion but rather one of caring and compassion.  “How to Change Minds coaches readers on the fine point of ethical persuasion. If you want to change minds the right way, reading this book is the right thing to do.” —Ken Blanchard, coauthor of The One Minute Manager and Trust Works!  “Equally adaptable to business and personal life, How to Change Minds offers a unique perspective on effecting positive change in personal and business relationships. Learn while being entertained by Rob’s personality-infused writing style.”  —Tom Ziglar, President, Ziglar Inc., and proud son of Zig Ziglar  “Rob’s insights on influence and persuasion are fascinating and presented in a powerful and entertaining way. This book is, perhaps, the 21st century’s version of How to Win Friends and Influence People.” —Dr. Eli Jones, Dean, Marketing Professor, Sam M. Walton Endowed Chair in Leadership, University of Arkansas
