Book Description
-----------------

“Graphics Programming with GDI+ explores and exploits a wonderful range of GDI+ programming concepts, techniques, and applications for programmers of beginner to intermediate abilities. Being a prolific contributor to the Internet community of developers, Mahesh Chand is offering what seems to be a natural extension of what he does best—sharing his programming skills with other talented programmers. Each chapter compels to the next.”
          —Jason Hattingh, Director, Greystone Digital FX
“Mahesh does a very good job getting .NET developers up to speed using the GDI+ features supported in the .NET Framework. There is good coverage of graphics fundamentals that helps the reader better understand the concepts of graphics programming with GDI+, and there are some excellent sample applications that demonstrate the graphics topics covered to reinforce the concepts presented.”
          —Charles G. Parker, President, Parallel Consulting, Inc.
“Graphics Programming with GDI+ is a comprehensive reference for anyone who wants to leverage this technology. It presents a clear discussion of the topics in such a manner that is comprehensible to the beginner, but sufficiently in-depth to challenge seasoned programmers.”
          —Deborah J. Bechtold, MCSD, MCDBA
"This is the most comprehensive book about graphics programming using GDI+ so far. This book will be a very useful handbook for everyone who does graphics programming for Windows."
         —Min Liu, Software Design Engineer of GDI+, Microsoft Corporation
Graphics Programming with GDI+ is the .NET developer's guide to writing graphics applications for Windows and the Web. Through the use of detailed examples it provides experienced programmers with a deep understanding of the entire GDI+ API defined in the .NET Framework class library.
The book begins with an introduction to GDI+ and the basics of graphics programming in Windows. The core of the book is a hands-on guide to practical topics, including how to use Windows Forms and optimize GDI+ performance. Chapters demonstrate how to develop real-world tools such as GDI+Painter, GDI+Editor, ImageViewer, and ImageAnimator. The author provides extensive reusable sample code in C# throughout, and complete downloadable source code in C# and Visual Basic .NET is available online, as are color versions of screen shots from the book.
Key topics include:
How GDI+ compares to GDI
How GDI+ is defined and used in the .NET Framework
How to draw, paint, and fill graphics objects
Viewing and manipulating images
Transforming graphics objects, images, and colors
Printing in .NET
How to develop GDI+ Web applications
How to optimize drawing quality and performance
Interactive color blending and transparent colors
GDI interoperability
Answers to frequently asked GDI+ questions
Graphics Programming in GDI+ is the most in-depth treatment available on writing effective graphics applications for the .NET Framework.
