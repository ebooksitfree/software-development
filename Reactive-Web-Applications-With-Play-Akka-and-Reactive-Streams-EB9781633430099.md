Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
Reactive Web Applications teaches web developers how to benefit from the reactive application architecture and presents hands-on examples using the Play framework.
About the Technology
Reactive applications build on top of components that communicate asynchronously as they react to user and system events. As a result, they become scalable, responsive, and fault-tolerant. Java and Scala developers can use the Play Framework and the Akka concurrency toolkit to easily implement reactive applications without building everything from scratch.
About the Book
Reactive Web Applications teaches web developers how to benefit from the reactive application architecture and pre-sents hands-on examples using Play, Akka, Scala, and Reactive Streams. This book starts by laying out the fundamentals required for writing functional and asynchronous applications and quickly introduces Play as a framework to handle the plumbing of your application. The book alternates between chapters that introduce reactive ideas (asynchronous programming with futures and actors, managing distributed state with CQRS) and practical examples that show you how to build these ideas into your applications.
Whatâ€™s Inside
Reactive application architecture
Basics of Play and Akka
Examples in Scala
Functional and asynchronous programming
About the Reader
For readers comfortable programming with a higher-level language such as Java or C#, and who can read Scala code. No experience with Play or Akka needed.
About the Author
Manuel Bernhardt is a passionate engineer, author, and speaker. As a consultant, he guides companies through the technological and organizational transformation to distributed computing.
