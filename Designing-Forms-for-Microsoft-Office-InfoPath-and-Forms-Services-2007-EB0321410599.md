Book Description
-----------------

"Microsoft Office InfoPath represents a revolutionary leap in XML technologies and a new paradigm for gathering business-critical information. I am delighted that Scott Roberts and Hagen Green, two distinguished members of the InfoPath product team, decided to share their experience in this book."
--From the Foreword by Jean Paoli, cocreator of XML 1.0 and Microsoft Office InfoPath
Microsoft Office InfoPath 2007 offers breakthrough tools for gathering, managing, and integrating business-critical information, and creating efficient forms-driven processes. Two longtime members of Microsoft's InfoPath product team have written the first comprehensive, hands-on guide to building successful XML-based solutions with InfoPath 2007.
The book opens with a practical primer on the fundamentals of InfoPath form template design for information workers and application developers at all levels of experience. It then moves into advanced techniques for customizing, integrating, and extending form templates--with all the code examples and detail needed by professional developers.
Learn how to:
Design form templates: create blank form templates, insert and customize controls, use advanced formatting, and construct and lay out views
Work with data: start with XML data or schema, manually edit data sources, and understand design-time visuals
Add custom business logic to forms, and integrate them with other applications
Retrieve and query data from external data sources, including XML files, databases, SharePoint lists, Web services, and ADO.NET DataSets
Submit and receive form data using ADO.NET
Save, preview, and publish to e-mail, SharePoint, and more
Build reusable components with template parts
Create workflows with SharePoint and InfoPath E-Mail Forms
Administer Forms Services and Web-enabled form templates
Build advanced form templates using C# form code, custom controls, add-ins, and the new InfoPath 2007 managed object model
Design form templates using Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO)
Update, secure, and optimize your form templates
