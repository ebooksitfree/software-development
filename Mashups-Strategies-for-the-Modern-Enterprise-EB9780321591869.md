Book Description

Creating Enterprise-Quality Web 2.0 Mashups: The Complete How-To Guide
Mashups give businesses powerful new ways to leverage today’s massive public and private data resources for competitive advantage. In Mashups: Strategies for the Modern Enterprise, J. Jeffrey Hanson brings together all the knowledge enterprise developers need to create mashups that are reliable, secure, flexible, and effective.
Using detailed sample code and third-party tools, Hanson walks readers through every step of creating a working enterprise mashup, as well as every component: presentation, process, data, and infrastructure. He surveys the styles, technologies, and standards used in mashup development, identifying key trade-offs and helping you choose the best options for your environment. You’ll learn how to overcome technical and business concerns associated with mashups, apply proven mashup patterns, and much more.
Coverage includes
 Understanding and using presentation-oriented, data-oriented, process-oriented, or hybrid mashup styles 
 Identifying the optimal uses for mashups in your environment 
 Up-front planning: requirements, constraints, and security considerations; stability, reliability, and performance issues 
 Creating an enterprise mashup, step by step: design, identification of services and data sources, and more 
 Creating effective frameworks for mashup mediation and monitoring 
 Applying proven patterns to your enterprise mashup infrastructure 
 Securing mashups: validation, HTML sanitization, protecting iframes, and avoiding common attacks, such as cross-site request forgery 
 Building mashups with third-party tools for Google, Oracle, Salesforce.com, Amazon, and other environments 
 Developing an open, agile environment that supports rapid, flexible development of new mashups  
Also of interest: The companion book, Mashup Patterns: Designs and Examples for the Modern Enterprise by Mike Ogrinz (Addison-Wesley), is an indispensable guide to patterns, with insights for making mashups work in production environments.
