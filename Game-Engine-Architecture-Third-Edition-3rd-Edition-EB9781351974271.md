Book Description
-----------------


    
    In this new and improved third edition of the highly popular Game Engine Architecture, Jason Gregory draws on his nearly two decades of experience at Midway, Electronic Arts and Naughty Dog to present both the theory and practice of game engine software development. In this book, the broad range of technologies and techniques used by AAA game studios are each explained in detail, and their roles within a real industrial-strength game engine are illustrated.

New to the Third Edition 
This third edition offers the same comprehensive coverage of game engine architecture provided by previous editions, along with updated coverage of:


computer and CPU hardware and memory caches,

compiler optimizations,

C++ language standardization,

the IEEE-754 floating-point representation,

2D user interfaces,

plus an entirely new chapter on hardware parallelism and concurrent programming.This book is intended to serve as an introductory text, but it also offers the experienced game programmer a useful perspective on aspects of game development technology with which they may not have deep experience. As always, copious references and citations are provided in this edition, making it an excellent jumping off point for those who wish to dig deeper into any particular aspect of the game development process.
&nbsp;
Key Features
Covers both the theory and practice of game engine software developmentExamples are grounded in specific technologies, but discussion extends beyond any particular engine or API.Includes all mathematical background needed.Comprehensive text for beginners and also has content for senior engineers.
