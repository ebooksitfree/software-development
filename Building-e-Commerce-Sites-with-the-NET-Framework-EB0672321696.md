Book Description
-----------------

There is currently no book on the market that has a case-study focus and builds e-commerce sites using the new Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Framework. In addition, many of the books that are likely to be released in the near future won't target the intermediate to advanced developer. Building e-commerce Sites describes the steps a developer will take to plan, develop and deploy an actual robust, scalable e-commerce application using the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET. There are detailed descriptions of design choices a developer makes, implementation details. The author's first hand experience will save the reader time and effort. Finally, the development of a working, modern e-commerce site is provided, in this case study approach, along with clear and simple explanations, screenshots, and step-by-step code excerpts.
