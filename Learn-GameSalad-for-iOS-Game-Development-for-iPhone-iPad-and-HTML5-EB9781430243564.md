Book Description
-----------------

So you have a great idea for an iPhone or iPad game, but you've never programmed before. Where to start? Here! With GameSalad, you can design, build, and publish a 2D game in the App Store using an easy-to-use, no-programming-required game creation tool.
Learn GameSalad for iOS shows you how to set up your development environment and how to create a variety of simple 2D games from a breakout-style game to an arcade shooter to a maze game. You'll also learn how to use GameSalad to create a non-game app as well. This book also takes you beyond game development into getting your game into the App Store, using iAd, and marketing your game.
