Book Description
-----------------

In Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD), developers work with customers and testers to create acceptance tests that thoroughly describe how software should work from the customer’s viewpoint. By tightening the links between customers and agile teams, ATDD can significantly improve both software quality and developer productivity.
This is the firststart-to-finish, real-world guide to ATDD for every agile project participant. Leading agile consultant Kenneth Houston Pugh begins with a dialogue among a developer, tester, and customer, explaining the “what, why, where, when, and how” of ATDD and illuminating the experience of participating in it.
Next, Pugh presents a practical, complete reference to each facet of ATDD, from creating simple tests to evaluating their results. He concludes with five diverse case studies, each identifying a realistic set of problems and challenges, together with proven solutions. Coverage includes 
 How to develop software with fully testable requirements 
 How to simplify and componentize tests and use them to identify missing logic 
 How to test user interfaces, service implementations, and other elements of a software system 
 How to identify requirements that are best handled outside software 
 How to present test results, evaluate them, and use them to assess overall progress 
 How to build acceptance tests that serve development organizations, not just customers 
 How to scale ATDD to even the largest projects
