Book Description
-----------------

Twitter Flight is an open source library from Twitter used heavily in their front end Javascript. It offers a lightweight way to define the behavior of and communication between components, which are well-defined fragments of a page meant for progressive enhancement.
This book was written for the curious Javascript developer who learns new libraries by hacking on examples or personal projects. We walk through developing a simple sample application - an RSS reader - using Twitter Flight and supporting libraries. Everything from basic components like tabs to remote data fetching is covered, highlighting the benefits Flight offers for event-driven applications.
