Book Description
-----------------

Start programming from scratch, no experience required. This beginners’ guide to software engineering starts with a discussion of the different editors used to create software and covers setting up a Docker environment. Next, you will learn about repositories and version control along with its uses. Now that you are ready to program, you’ll go through the basics of Python, the ideal language to learn as a novice software engineer. Many modern applications need to talk to a database of some kind, so you will explore how to create and connect to a database and how to design one for your app. Additionally you will discover how to use &nbsp;Python’s Flask microframework and how to efficiently test your code. Finally, the book explains best practices in coding, design, deployment, and security.&nbsp;
