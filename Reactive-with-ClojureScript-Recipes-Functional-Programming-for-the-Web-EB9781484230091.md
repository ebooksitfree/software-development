Book Description
-----------------

      Use ClojureScript to create powerful serverless Web applications that are responsive and engaging. This book presents Reactive recipes with Reagent, a ClojureScript reactive framework, to create interactive applications. Throughout the book, Reactive with ClojureScript  Recipes uses progressively more complex examples and introduces you to a set of powerful tools that target rapid web application development. In the last chapter, you'll use these concepts for an HTML5-based deployment to smart phones.ClojureScript is your functional programming language for the web. ClojureScript looks like a LISP, and compiles to JavaScript, and thus runs nicely run in the browser. What You'll LearnWrite simple static web apps with BootIintegrate ClojureScript and its librariesAnimate content, play with sound and videos Use Reagent, and be Reactive in the browser.Run your Application on a smart phones.Who This Book Is ForClojure developers who want to turn their functional skills to the web and JavaScript advanced developers who want reuse their web skills in a different language
