Book Description
-----------------

Understand essential computer science concepts and skills. This book focuses on the foundational and fundamental concepts upon which expertise in specific areas can be developed, including computer architecture, programming language, algorithm and data structure, operating systems, computer networks, distributed systems, security, and more.
According to code.org, there are 500,000 open programming positions available in the US— compared to an annual crop of just 50,000 graduating computer science majors. The US Department of Labor predicted that there will be almost a million and a half computer science jobs in the very near future, but only enough programmers to fill roughly one third of these jobs.
To bridge the gap, many people not formally trained in computer science are employed in programming jobs. Although they are able to start programming and coding quickly, it often takes them time to acquire the necessary understanding to gain the requisite skills to become an efficient computer engineer or advanced developer. 

What You Will Learn
The fundamentals of how a computer worksThe basics of computer programming and programming paradigmsHow to write efficient&nbsp;programsHow the hardware and software work together to provide a good user experience&nbsp;and enhance the usability of the systemHow computers can talk to each otherHow to ensure the security of the systemThe fundamentals of cloud offerings, implications/trade-offs, and deployment/adoption configurationsThe fundamentals of machine learning
Who This Book Is For
Computer programmers lacking a formal education in computer science, and anyone with a formal education in computer science, looking to develop a general understanding of computer science fundamentals
