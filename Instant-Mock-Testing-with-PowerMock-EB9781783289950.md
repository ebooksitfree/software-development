Book Description
-----------------

 Discover unit testing using PowerMock 
Learn something new in an Instant! A short, fast, focused guide delivering immediate resultsUnderstand how to test unit code using PowerMock, through hands-on-examplesLearn how to avoid unwanted behaviour of code using PowerMock for testingExplore the features of PowerMock through the selection of clear, practical, step-by-step recipesIn Detail
Writing good unit tests can be hard in situations where we have to deal with static, final, or private methods. Sometimes, even a good design is sacrificed for the sake of testability. A mocking frameworkâ€™s ability to create mocks for almost any scenario enables us to focus on accurately programming for a business environment.
Starting with a basic example of how to create a mock and verify a method invocation Instant Testing with PowerMock then demonstrates various features of PowerMock using clear, practical, step-by-step recipes. By the end of this book, you will be able to write unit tests for almost any scenario and suppress unwanted behaviour to effectively unit test your code.
Moving on from the basics, you will learn to write unit tests for static, final, and private methods, and write flexible unit tests using argument matchers. Following on from this, you will also learn how to mock a few methods of a class, and invoke real implementation of others using partial mocks or spies. This book will teach you the tricks of the trade that will enable you to write good unit tests for a wide range of scenarios.
