-----------------

C++ remains a popular object-oriented language and Sams Teach Yourself C++ in 10 Minutes provides a quick, focused way to learn the language.

The material is reorganized to fit proven teaching techniques with about thirty percent of the text rewritten. All examples are new to comply with the current ANSI C++ standard and make them completely compatible with all popular compilers.
