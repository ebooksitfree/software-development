A new edition of this title is available, ISBN-10: 0137144156 ISBN-13: 9780137144150
The practicing programmer's DEITEL® guide to C# and the powerful Microsoft .NET Framework
Written for programmers with a background in C++, Java, or other high-level languages, this book applies the Deitel signature live-code approach to teaching programming and explores Microsoft's C# language and the new .NET 2.0 in depth. The book is updated for Visual Studio® 2005 and C# 2.0, and presents C# concepts in the context of fully tested programs, complete with syntax shading, detailed line-by-line code descriptions, and program outputs. The book features 200+ C# applications with 16,000+ lines of proven C# code, as well as 300+ programming tips that will help you build robust applications.
Start with a concise introduction to C# fundamentals using an early classes and objects approach, then rapidly move on to more advanced topics, including multithreading, XML, ADO.NET 2.0, ASP.NET 2.0, Web services, network programming, and .NET remoting. Along the way you will enjoy the Deitels' classic treatment of object-oriented programming and a new, OOD/UML™ ATM case study, including a complete C# implementation. When you are finished, you will have everything you need to build next-generation Windows applications, Web applications, and Web services.
