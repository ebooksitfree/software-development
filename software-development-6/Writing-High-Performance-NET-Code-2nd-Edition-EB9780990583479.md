Book Description
-----------------

 Take performance to the next level!This book does not just teach you how the CLR works---it teaches you exactly  what you need to do now to obtain the best performance today. It will expertly guide  you through the nuts and bolts of extreme performance optimization in .NET, complete  with in-depth examinations of CLR functionality, free tool recommendations and tutorials,  useful anecdotes, and step-by-step guides to measure and improve performance.
This second edition incorporates the advances and improvements in .NET over the  last few years, as well as greatly expanded coverage of tools, more topics, more  tutorials, more tips, and improvements throughout the entire book.
