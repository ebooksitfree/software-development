Advanced secure printing from smartphones: how Xerox is leveraging the cloud to deliver a new generation of printing innovation.
People occasionally need to print something from the phone: email attachments, presentations, brochures, or customized information sheets. Although Xerox could easily add Bluetooth or WiFi to its multifunction devices, new hardware isnâ€™t needed: most are already connected to the Internet, as are most smartphones. This leads to networked print services, sometimes called cloud printing.
