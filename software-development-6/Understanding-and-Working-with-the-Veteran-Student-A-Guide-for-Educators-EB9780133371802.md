Book Description
-----------------

As classrooms become filled with veterans, instructors need to understand how to effectively assist them with maximizing their learning experience and preparing them for their future careers. This is an incredible responsibility. We owe a great debt to those who have served our country and its citizens faithfully. We must remember the mistakes we made as a society with our previous veterans so that we do not make them again. Providing financial assistance alone is not sufficient. We must take a holistic approach. Many veteran students need help reintegrating back into civilian society. They need psychological and family support, assistance accessing benefits, and freedom from judgment and misconceptions. This ebook is designed to help smooth this transition and help our veterans make the most of their educational opportunities.
