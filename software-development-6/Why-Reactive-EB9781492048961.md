Book Description
-----------------

 It’s often difficult to separate hype from reality when it comes to evaluating new technologies, and that’s certainly true of reactive programming. In this report, author Konrad Malawski analyzes reactive principles, and explains how and when it makes sense to adopt this relatively new programming paradigm for systems design.
Many ideas behind the reactive paradigm aren’t new, such as the actor-based programming model, but with recent trends in cloud computing, mobile app development, and the rise of the IoT sector, reactive is taking off in mainstream enterprise software development. This report takes you on a deep dive into the technical aspects of reactive and explores areas where this architecture can be a good fit for your organization.
You’ll explore:
Reactive on the application level: apply reactive principles within a single application, and understand its impact on resource utilizationReactive on the system level: examine the architectural and organizational impact of distributed reactive applicationsBuilding blocks of reactive systems: learn about several tools that will facilitate your move toward reactive programming        Show and hide more
