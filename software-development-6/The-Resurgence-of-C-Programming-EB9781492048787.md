Book Description
-----------------

 Although high-level languages such as Java and Python are popular choices among programmers, there’s a lot of renewed interest in the venerable C language. In this report, Mike Barlow examines how the widespread use of embedded software, and the emergence of the maker movement and open-source hardware, have led people back to the language that maps more efficiently to machine instructions.
Through interviews with a dozen technology leaders, educators, makers, and embedded software developers, you’ll learn about many examples that demonstrate C’s ubiquity, especially as the lines between software development and hardware design become less distinct. Embedded software developers who work on devices for Internet of Things find C/C++ indispensable, but so do people who tackle custom hardware projects with Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
Pick up a copy of this report and learn how C/C++ enables programmers to extract maximum performance from the underlying hardware resources—especially in situations where you need real-time performance.
