Master wxWidgets from start to finish–even if you've never built GUI applications before
Leverage advanced wxWidgets capabilities: networking, multithreading, streaming, and more
CD-ROM: library of development tools, source code, and sample applications
Foreword by Mitch Kapor, founder, Lotus Development and Open Source Application Foundation
wxWidgets is an easy-to-use, open source C++ API for writing GUI applications that run on Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, and even Pocket PC–supporting each platform's native look and feel with virtually no additional coding. Now, its creator and two leading developers teach you all you need to know to write robust cross-platform software with wxWidgets. This book covers everything from dialog boxes to drag-and-drop, from networking to multithreading. It includes all the tools and code you need to get great results, fast. From AMD to AOL, Lockheed Martin to Xerox, world-class developers are using wxWidgets to save money, increase efficiency, and reach new markets. With this book, you can, too.
wxWidgets quickstart: event/input handling, window layouts, drawing, printing, dialogs, and more
Working with window classes, from simple to advanced
Memory management, debugging, error checking, internationalization, and other advanced topics
Includes extensive code samples for Windows, Linux (GTK+), and Mac OS X
About the CD-ROM
The CD-ROM contains all of the source code from the book; wxWidgets distributions for Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, and other platforms; the wxWidgets reference guide; and development tools including the OpenWatcom C++ compiler, the poEdit translation helper, and the DialogBlocks user interface builder.
