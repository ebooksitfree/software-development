Book Description
-----------------


    
    Automate core security tasks by embedding security controls and processes early in the DevOps workflow through DevSecOps.&nbsp;You will not only learn the various stages in the DevOps pipeline through examples of solutions developed and deployed using .NET Core, but also go through open source SDKs and toolkits that will help you to incorporate automation, security, and compliance.&nbsp;


The book starts with an outline of modern software engineering principles and gives you an overview of DevOps in .NET Core. It further explains automation in DevOps for product development along with security principles to improve product quality. Next, you will learn how to improve your product quality and avoid code issues such as SQL injection prevention, cross-site scripting, and many more. Moving forward, you will go through the steps necessary to make&nbsp;security, compliance, audit, and UX automated to increase the efficiency of your organization. Youâ€™ll see demonstrations of the CI phase of DevOps, on-premise and hosted, along with code analysis methods to verify product quality. Finally, you will learn network security in Docker and containers followed by compliance and security standards.&nbsp;

After reading DevSecOps for .NET Core, you will be able to understand&nbsp;how automation, security, and compliance works in all the stages of the DevOps pipeline while showcasing real-world examples of solutions developed and deployed using .NET Core 3.
