Book Description
-----------------

Differential forms are a powerful mathematical technique to help students, researchers, and engineers solve problems in geometry and analysis, and their applications. They both unify and simplify results in concrete settings, and allow them to be clearly and effectively generalized to more abstract settings. Differential Forms has gained high recognition in the mathematical and scientific community as a powerful computational tool in solving research problems and simplifying very abstract problems. Differential Forms, 2nd Edition, is a solid resource for students and professionals needing a general understanding of the mathematical theory and to be able to apply that theory into practice.
Provides a solid theoretical basis of how to develop and apply differential forms to real research problemsIncludes computational methods to enable the reader to effectively use differential formsIntroduces theoretical concepts in an accessible manner
