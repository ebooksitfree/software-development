Book Description
-----------------

 Developing expert level application development skills with C++
About This Book​Take ​advantage ​of ​the ​myriad ​of ​features ​and ​possibilities ​that ​C++ offers ​to ​build real-world ​applicationsDelve into the fundamentals of multithreading and concurrency and find out how to implement themLearn the latest features of C++ and how to write better code by using the Standard LibraryWho This Book Is ForThis ​course ​is​ ​for​ ​intermediate to advanced level​ ​C++ ​developers who want to get the most out of C++ to build concurrent and scalable application.
What You Will LearnWrite ​modular ​C++ ​applications ​in ​terms ​of ​the ​existing ​and newly ​introduced ​featuresIdentify ​code-smells, ​clean ​up, ​and ​refactor ​legacy ​C++ applications​Leverage ​the ​possibilities ​provided ​by ​Cucumber ​and ​Google Test/Mock ​to automate ​test ​casesDeep dive into the details of the how various operating systems currently implement multithreadingChoose the best multithreading APIs when designing a new applicationExplore the use of mutexes, spin-locks, and other synchronization concepts and see how to safely pass data between threadsWork with strings the STL way instead of handcrafting C-style codeUnderstand standard support classes for concurrency and synchronization, and how to put them to workUse the filesystem library addition available with the C++17 STLIn DetailC++ has ​come ​a ​long ​way ​and ​has ​now ​been ​adopted ​in ​several ​contexts. Its ​key ​strengths ​are ​its ​software ​infrastructure ​and ​resource-constrained applications. ​The ​C++ ​17 ​release ​will ​change ​the ​way ​developers ​write code, ​and ​this ​course ​will ​help ​you ​master ​your ​developing ​skills ​with ​C++. With ​real-world, ​practical ​examples ​explaining ​each ​concept, ​the ​course is divided into three modules where ​will begin ​by ​introducing ​you ​to ​the ​latest ​features ​in ​C++ ​17. ​It ​encourages clean ​code ​practices ​in ​C++ ​in ​general ​and ​demonstrates ​the ​GUI app-development ​options ​in ​C++. ​You’ll ​get ​tips ​on ​avoiding ​memory ​leaks using ​smart-pointers. ​
In the next module, ​you’ll ​see ​how ​multi-threaded ​programming can ​help ​you ​achieve ​concurrency ​in ​your ​applications. We start with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of multithreading and concurrency concepts. We then take an in-depth look at how these concepts work at the hardware-level as well as how both operating systems and frameworks use these low-level functions.
You will learn about the native multithreading and concurrency support available in C++ since the 2011 revision, synchronization and communication between threads, debugging concurrent C++ applications, and the best programming practices in C++.
Moving ​on, ​you’ll ​get ​an ​in-depth ​understanding ​of ​the ​C++ ​Standard Template ​Library. ​Where we show implementation-specific, problem-solution approach that will help you quickly overcome hurdles. You will learn the core STL concepts, such as containers, algorithms, utility classes, lambda expressions, iterators, and more while working on practical real-world recipes. These recipes will help you get the most from the STL and show you how to program in a better way.
