 The Next-Generation Business on Microsoft's Distributed Ledger Platform
About This BookExplore the latest Azure Blockchain Workbench to ease blockchain developmentLearn how to build distributed ledger in the Azure ecosystemDiscover ways to secure your distributed applications using Azure ADWho This Book Is ForThe book is intended for Blockchain developers and professionals, solution architects, and cloud administrators who want to ease the development of decentralized applications using the services and tools in Microsoft Azure.
What You Will LearnCreating and Managing a Blockchain application in AzureDeploy Azure Blockchain WorkbenchConfigure A Blockchain Application in AzureManage the size of the Network For Optimal PerformanceAutomate development with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templatesBuild an enterprise scale blockchain applicationsIn DetailIn an age of rapid technological innovation, Blockchain (or distributed technology) is described as the most disruptive technology in decades, with the potential to transform entire industries and government agencies. As with all major paradigm shifts, successful adoption is largely dependent on choosing the right platform and getting to market quickly with a best in class solutions.
This book will use Microsoft's Azure Blockchain Workbench to simplify the delivery of world class Blockchain solutions. Whether you are at the conceptual, POC, architecture design or development phase, the author uses practical examples and case studies throughout the book. You will understand how to use a solution template to seamlessly deploy components required to create blockchain applications. Furthermore ,you will be using the Workbench automatic ledger deployment, network construction and pre-built blockchain commands to accelerate infrastructure delivery. Then you will understand how to link blockchain identities with Azure Active Directory (AD) to simplify authentication and collaboration. The book will then focus on how you can ingest messages and events required to trigger smart contracts with Service Bus and Event Hubs. You will understand how signing, hashing, and routing tools convert messages into the proper format required by the Azure Blockchain Workbench native API. Lastly, you will learn how to synchronize your on-chain data with off-chain data to simplify query attestations and gain full transparency into ledger activity.
By the end of the book, you will be able to build Blockchain solutions on Azure Blockchain Workbench.
