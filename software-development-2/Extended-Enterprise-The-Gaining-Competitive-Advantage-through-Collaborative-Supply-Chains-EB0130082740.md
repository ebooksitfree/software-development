Book Description
-----------------

You can't compete and win alone. Today, constellations of firms ally against each other--and the firm that stands alone, may fail alone. Now there's a start-to-finish guide to the opportunities and challenges facing today's extended enterprise. In The Extended Enterprise, authors Edward W. Davis and Robert E. Spekman show why extended enterprises demand radically new buyer-supplier relationships, why traditional business structures inhibit alliances and partnerships, and how to develop the competencies your company needs right now.
Drawing on extensive research and new case studies, you get realistic strategies for planning, building, and managing the extended enterprise. You'll learn how to decide when to partner and who to partner with; align processes to improve information flow; and especially, develop people who'll work well across organizational boundaries. Above all, the authors offer deep insight into the attitudinal and behavioral changes that are needed in order to rapidly achieve results and sustain them for the long term.
