Book Description
-----------------

Summary
Dart in Action introduces Google's Dart language and provides techniques and examples showing how to use it as a viable replacement for Java and JavaScript in browser-based desktop and mobile applications. It begins with a rapid overview of Dart language and tools, including features like interacting with the browser, optional typing, classes, libraries, and concurrency with isolates. After you master the core concepts, you'll move on to running Dart on the server and creating single page HTML5 web applications.
About the Technology
Dart is a web programming language developed by Google. It has modern OO features, just like Java or C#, while keeping JavaScript’s dynamic and functional characteristics. Dart applications are “transpiled” to JavaScript, and they run natively in Dart-enabled browsers. With production-quality libraries and tools, Dart operates on both the client and the server for a consistent development process.
About this Book
Dart in Action introduces the Dart language and teaches you to use it in browser-based, desktop, and mobile applications. Not just a language tutorial, this book gets quickly into the nitty-gritty of using Dart. Most questions that pop up while you’re reading are answered on the spot! OO newbies will appreciate the gentle pace in the early chapters. Later chapters take a test-first approach and encourage you to try Dart hands-on.
To benefit from this book you’ll need experience with HTML and JavaScripta Java or C# background is helpful but not required.
