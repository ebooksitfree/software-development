Book Description
-----------------

ASQ 2007 CROSBY MEDAL WINNER!
An Integrated Technology for Delivering Better Software—Cheaper and Faster!
This book presents an integrated technology, Design for Trustworthy Software (DFTS), to address software quality issues upstream such that the goal of software quality becomes that of preventing bugs in implementation rather than finding and eliminating them during and after implementation. The thrust of the technology is that major quality deployments take place before a single line of code is written!
This customer-oriented integrated technology can help deliver breakthrough results in cost, quality, and delivery schedule thus meeting and exceeding customer expectations. The authors describe the principles behind the technology as well as their applications to actual software design problems. They present illustrative case studies covering various aspects of DFTS technology including CoSQ, AHP, TRIZ, FMEA, QFD, and Taguchi Methods and provide ample questions and exercises to test the readers understanding of the material in addition to detailed examples of the applications of the technology.
The book can be used to impart organization-wide learning including training for DFTS Black Belts and Master Black Belts. It helps you gain rapid mastery, so you can deploy DFTS Technology quickly and successfully.
Learn how to
•    Plan, build, maintain, and improve your trustworthy software development system
•    Adapt best practices of quality, leadership, learning, and management for the unique software development milieu
•    Listen to the customer’s voice, then guide user expectations to realizable, reliable software products
•    Refocus on customer-centered issues such as reliability, dependability, availability, and upgradeability
•    Encourage greater design creativity and innovation
•    Validate, verify, test, evaluate, integrate, and maintain software for trustworthiness
•    Analyze the financial impact of software quality
•    Prepare your leadership and infrastructure for DFTS
Design for Trustworthy Software will help you improve quality whether you develop in-house, outsource, consult, or provide support. It offers breakthrough solutions for the entire spectrum of software and quality professionals—from developers to project leaders, chief software architects to customers.
The American Society for Quality (ASQ) is the world's leading authority on quality which provides a community that advances learning, quality improvement, and knowledge exchange to improve business results, and to create better workplaces and communities worldwide. The Crosby Medal is presented to the individual who has authored a distinguished book contributing significantly to the extension of the philosophy and application of the principles, methods, or techniques of quality management.
