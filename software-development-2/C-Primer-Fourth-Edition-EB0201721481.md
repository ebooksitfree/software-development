Book Description
-----------------

"C++ Primer is well known as one of the best books for learning C++ and is useful for C++ programmers of all skill levels. This Fourth Edition not only keeps this tradition alive, it actually improves on it." --Steve Vinoski, Chief Engineer, Product Innovation, IONA Technologies
"The Primer really brings this large and complex language down to size." --Justin Shaw, Senior Member of Technical Staff, Electronic Programs Division, The Aerospace Corporation
"It not only gets novices up and running early, but gets them to do so using good programming practices." --Nevin ":-)" Liber, Senior Principal Engineer (C++ developer since 1988)
This popular tutorial introduction to standard C++ has been completely updated, reorganized, and rewritten to help programmers learn the language faster and use it in a more modern, effective way.
Just as C++ has evolved since the last edition, so has the authors' approach to teaching it. They now introduce the C++ standard library from the beginning, giving readers the means to write useful programs without first having to master every language detail. Highlighting today's best practices, they show how to write programs that are safe, can be built quickly, and yet offer outstanding performance. Examples that take advantage of the library, and explain the features of C++, also show how to make the best use of the language. As in its previous editions, the book's authoritative discussion of fundamental C++ concepts and techniques makes it a valuable resource even for more experienced programmers.
Program Faster and More Effectively with This Rewritten Classic
Restructured for quicker learning, using the C++ standard library
Updated to teach the most current programming styles and program design techniques
Filled with new learning aids that emphasize important points, warn about common pitfalls, suggest good programming practices, and provide general usage tips
Complete with exercises that reinforce skills learned
Authoritative and comprehensive in its coverage
